It has a huge following world wide, Nigeria inclusive. Ubuntu Nigeria LoCo (Local Community) is a group made up of Ubuntu users in Nigeria, with the goals of &#8220;[advocating, distributing, advertising, demonstrating and developing local attributes into Ubuntu within Nigeria](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NigerianTeam)&#8220;.
  
Ubuntu Nigeria LoCo, best as I can figure, was founded in 2008. However, shortly after, it fizzled out and died.
  
Sometime in 2010, I took a stab at reviving it, even getting a few things going for a few weeks or so, but I didn&#8217;t really know what I was doing, and once school work caught up with me, I stopped working on it and it got its second burial.
  
Like the saying goes, third time&#8217;s the charm. I&#8217;m taking another stab at reviving this LoCo, and this time, I&#8217;m gonna do it right!.
  
Wish me luck.
