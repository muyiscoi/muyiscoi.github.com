<p>As at 3pm today, my MSc programme officially comes to an end.</p>
<p>Its been one of the most enlightening experience of my life till date. I've been exposed both intellectually, culturally, emotionally, etc. I've developed a renewed confidence in my abilities and a better idea of what my strengths and weaknesses are.</p>
<p>I am very happy for the opportunity to go through this process, and even though there is a sense of dread now that there is no obvious next step for me, its an opportunity to look within and try to figure out what i really wanna do, and how to do so. Can't wait to discover what that is!.</p>
