  content: I had Linux Mint &#47; Zorin on my laptop with Win 7 in a VM. That was
    until Win 8 came on board. Sad to say, I have not looked back since. Thing is,
    Win 8 is the future - at least I think so. I strongly suggest you still give it
    a try.

  content: "I currently have two operating systems installed namely: Windows 7 &amp;
    Linux Mint 13, all 64bit.\r\nDespite all my experience using PCLinuxOS, I can't
    remember when last I booted into Linux, everything I need is already on my Windows.
    \r\nI like having Linux installed though, just in case of situations where I might
    need it."

  content: hmmm... so you have deserted linux? after all the battles you fought with
    PCLinuxOS :D. Anyway, I guess its different strokes. Have you tested out Windows
    8? What were your impressions if you have. Also, I hear that Android SDK works
    much better under linux so you might wanna check that out in your App dev endeavours.

  content: "I didn't desert Linux, I still have it installed. It's just that I find
    Windows to be more user friendly, and everything I can do on Linux, I can do more
    on windows.\r\nI'm planning to download the Android sdk on Linux but I'm still
    undecided about what version of Linux to stick to.\r\nI might end up downloading
    Ubuntu soon :)"

<p><a href="https:&#47;&#47;ubuntu.com&#47;download"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-392" alt="Avoid the pain of Windows 8." src="https:&#47;&#47;www.muyiscoi.com&#47;blog&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;12&#47;ubuntu1210.home_-580x236.jpg" width="580" height="236" &#47;><&#47;a>I recently got a new laptop, as I mentioned in a <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.muyiscoi.com&#47;?p=386">previous post<&#47;a>. While trying to repartition the harddrive, I succeeded in royally messing up the Windows 8 installed on it!. I don't want to go into exact details on how this happened but, suffice it to say, it did and I was pretty messed up about it as you might imagine. You see, I also messed up the recovery partition and since I didn't have the foresight of creating a recovery disk, I was now without a way of reinstalling Windows 8 on my spanking new machine.</p>
<p>I had previously dual-booted <a href="https:&#47;&#47;ubuntu.com">Ubuntu<&#47;a> on it however, and that partition was still intact so I performed a <a href="https:&#47;&#47;help.ubuntu.com&#47;community&#47;Boot-Repair">Boot Repair<&#47;a> and had a bootable OS on my Laptop. I have been using Ubuntu on my Computers for about 5 years now (began with Ubuntu 7.04 way back in 2007). I have however, always installed it alongside windows. There have been several reasons for this.<br />
In the early days, not everything worked properly; in fact, the touchpad didnt even work on my Hp 500 Laptop with Ubuntu 7.04 until I did a kernel update. So, I was skeptical about taking the plunge. I was also very new to the OS and didn't want to doom myself while learning something new. Thirdly, I was still in school and required Windows for some applications such as MatLab, <a href="https:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Proteus_%28design_software%29">Proteus<&#47;a>, and of course Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>Fast forward 5 years and I am no longer a novice Ubuntu user, In fact, in some circles, I am considered a bit of an expert :) . I am also no longer in the University (atleast for now) and whatever app I need for work or learning is available or has a capable alternative on Ubuntu. I however, still dualboot my laptop. I always dreamed of a time when I would have only Ubuntu on my Laptop but that day just didn't seem imminent.<br />
When this new device landed, I didn't hesitate to do what I've always done. Shrink the Windows partition, Install Ubuntu on some of the space, and leave the rest as a neutral partition for "Stuff" shared by both Ubuntu and Windows. Even though I no longer really "needed" Windows, I didn't want to just discard it, especially since it had contributed to the overall cash I just plopped down for my new baby.</p>
<p>With the way things turned out though, I was left with only Ubuntu on my machine and after doing some research, I learned that I would have to delete the harddisk's partition table before I could reinstall Windows because of the drive using <a href="https:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;GPT_Partition">GPT style partitions<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>All this just made me think about what I really needed windows for, and for now, the answer is, nothing really. I can do just about anything I want using Ubuntu. My gaming doesnt exceed a few sessions of Solitaire or Sudoku so I don't need windows for that either. Windows 8, from the little I used of it before I borked everything, didn't make a really good case for itself and I'll much rather prefer my full screen apps on devices that are better suited for them. It all dawned on me that this would be a really good time to do what I've always dreamed of doing; having only Ubuntu installed on my machine.<br />
So, that's what I'm doing :D.</p>
<p>I formatted the partition that was supposed to have windows and I've installed a Windows 7 VM in there via virtualbox. Now, I know what you're thinking; this dude just said he doesnt need windows and now he's installing it in a VM. The fact is, you never know. I might need to do something that can only be done on Windows (wonder what that could be) and would rather have a Windows VM already setup and ready to go than have to set one up at a moment's notice.<br />
So, I have a new laptop (which I like very much by the way), and its running only one OS, Ubuntu 12.10 64bit version.</p>
<p>Since I am not doing this out of any sense of<a href="https:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Free_software"> freedom (as in free speech)<&#47;a> or <a href="https:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Open-source_software">Opensource<&#47;a> idealology, but just because I think Ubuntu is a superior OS, I am leaving the option of reinstalling windows on my laptop open for now. I'm considering purchasing a Windows 8 pro license ($99) and just keeping it for such an occasion. If i do decide to do that, it'll be while upgrading to Ubuntu 13.04 next April!.</p>
<p>Watch this space... if you like :D.</p>
