As the title says, that is what we have been experiencing over here in PH. The continuous rainfall took a break this morning and I thought it would last. I went out to carry out some long overdue business and while in the taxi, the sun began to get very intense. I was wishing it wasnt so sunny. Oh how my wish was answered.

I entered a shop to buy some CD/R&#8217;s and after spending a few minutes there (while the cashier fumbled for my change), i step out only to see rain in full gear. Wasnt this the sunny weather I had just left for a few minutes? It was hard to believe that so much rain could have fallen in so short a time &#8230; but it had. And it didnt seem to be going away anytime soon.

I plunged into it and got myself wet within seconds but i didnt have a choice. So now, i have liquid on my shirt which is a peculiar mixture of sweat and water. Phew! what a day!

At least, today&#8217;s experience was not as bad as the one that inspired me to write [this](http://www.naijastories.com/2010/08/rainy-day/) piece.
