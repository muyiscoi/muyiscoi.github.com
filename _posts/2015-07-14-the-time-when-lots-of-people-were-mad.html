<p><em>These are a series of posts from my time working in the retail division of the Commercial department at a major Nigerian Telco. </em></p>
<p>I worked at a smaller "mini" shop for the majority of my time at the telco, and for a couple of months, we realized that our foot traffic, and as a result, revenue was on a constant decline. Something had to be done to bring more people into the door and get them to buy stuff.</p>
<p>The powers that be decided to send out an SMS blast to all the numbers within a specific geographical radius of the shop, informing them of the shop's location, and that they can get lots of cool stuff there and have their issues resolved.</p>
<p>It all sounded nice until we actually got the SMS on our own phones. The message had been poorly worded, and could be interpreted to mean that customers can come to the shop and get a gift.</p>
<p>The SMS was sent over the weekend, and we all came to work the following monday to a crowd of people. More people than I had ever seen through all the months I worked at that shop. In that regard, the SMS worked I guess. What most definitely didn't work was the reason why they were there. They all felt that they had won some sort of price and came to claim it.</p>
<p>When they were told the real meaning of the message, a lot of them did not take it well, to put it mildly. The next few hours were spent trying to placate a group of angry people who only seemed to get angrier, bolstered by the fact that they were part of a group. As the day went on though, the crowd slowly dissipated as I assume some of them had to go to work/ other more important engagements.</p>
<p>There was really nothing we could do other than continuous apologies, and eventually, even the most adamant of them left. Over the next couple of days, and indeed weeks, we had people coming with the SMS to request their prize, with some of them proceeding to flip out when told there wasn't any. It wasn't as bad as the first day though, and the intensity reduced as time went on.</p>
<p>It definitely an experience.</p>
