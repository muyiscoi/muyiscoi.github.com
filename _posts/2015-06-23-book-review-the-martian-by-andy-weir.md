Things go wrong for the mission not long after they land on Mars and they have to abort, but in the process, the protagonist Mark Watney has an accident and is presumed dead. A series of circumstances occurred though that ensured that Mark didn&#8217;t actually die, however, by the time he regained consciousness, his colleagues had left the red planet, taking the ship with them. So, Mark found himself grounded on Mars, and had to find ways to survive, while devising a means of getting the attention of NASA, and ultimately, going back home.

<!--more-->The first few chapters of the book are exclusively from the log entries of Mark Whatney in space, and this is the only way the reader gets to experience what happens to him, and all that he has been able to accomplish/overcome. In my opinion, this is clever, as it provided a way for the author to focus on the sciencey bits without getting bogged down in the obvious emotional toll Mark Whatney must be facing. Afterall, he isn&#8217;t likely to post a log entry stating how depressed he was.

After a few chapters though, the focus switches to Earth and we are introduced to other characters from NASA, as well as all that transpires there. These chapters were a nice change of pace, as quite frankly, the log entries were getting a bit tired. When the book switches back to Whatney, I am now again interested in his shenanigans, as I can think about it from his perspective, as well as how it affects the other characters that have been introduced.

The introduction of the other crew members and their ordeal in their return flight back to earth also helps flesh out the story, and make Mark more into a real life person, and not just one &#8220;_super smart astronaut guy&#8221;_.

Another device used in this book is something I like to call &#8220;God mode&#8221;. In a few chapters, the focus switches to a omniscient type narrator who just describes what is happening, or describes what has happened in the current location overtime, in order to setup something about to happen to the protagonist. This works well in most cases, but I think it could have been used more.

One area where I feel the &#8220;God mode&#8221; would have been particularly effective is in exploring the emotional and physiological strain living in Mars alone would have placed on Mark. We could have had a scene where the &#8220;God Mode&#8221; narrator showed a breakdown of some sort from Mark, and then later, when the focus switches to the log entries, Mark just briefly mentions that he was &#8220;feeling down&#8221;. This provides the effect that log readers would not give that comment a second thought, however, with the luxury of the &#8220;God mode&#8221;, we could see that it was definitely more than feeling a little blue, and that, in my opinion, would have humanized our protagonist more, and made him more relatable.

The writing style of The Martian is simple enough, however, it is littered with lots of technical jargon as well as hard mathematics which could make it a bit difficult to follow.

This book is highly technical, and from what I&#8217;ve read, the maths and science are all pretty accurate to real life. The amount of research put into this book is evident to any reader, and it is indeed a feat to be commended.

At some point in the book, it became evident to me that Mark Whatney is not a human being. He is smarter than anyone I know, has a vast knowledge of everything from all forms of Engineering to Botany, Aeronautics, Navigation, Cosmology, Construction, etc. It didn&#8217;t matter what kind of terrible situation he found himself in, he was sure to think up an ingenious solution it it.

This isn&#8217;t a particularly bad skill for your protagonist to have, however, it meant that whenever he got himself into the next scrape, I was just counting the pages until he thought up a way out of it. In some weird way, the chapters on Earth became more engaging than those on Mars at that point.

Overall, The Martian is a very nice book, and a fast read. I learnt a lot about Mars and space travel in general.

I can&#8217;t wait to see the Movie Adaptation in a few months.
