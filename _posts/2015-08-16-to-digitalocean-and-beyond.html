<p>So, since I registered this domain in 2010, it has been the home of my personal website/blog in its numerous incarnations, hosted on a <a href="http://smartweb.com.ng">shared hosting service</a>.</p>
<p>This has mostly served me well, despite the sometimes flaky uptime, mostly cos my site has a non-existent readership. Despite this fact, I've always wanted to host my site on a home server, so now, I'm doing that, or atleast the next best thing.</p>
<p>I just migrated my site to a droplet on Digital ocean. I also took the opportunity to move it to a folder, leaving the homepage as a kind of about me type thing, which i'm hopefully gonna design within the next week.</p>
<p>This is part of my larger plan to self host as much of the services that I use as possible. There are lots of awesome opensource software out there for just about any service you might want, and I intend to take advantage of them, and rid myself of an over dependence on large companies.</p>
<p>That's the plan right now anyway. We'll see how it goes. For now, at least I have liberated my site from a shared host, so i no longer have to cover my face in shame. :D</p>
