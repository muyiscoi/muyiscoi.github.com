  content: I believe the issue with suspend was addressed in 10.04? Again, i feel

    still does.How far with your Mandriva review/comments?

  content: Yes i did. Something about a free hosting for a year right. It's a
    very generous offer. Thanks. I already have my site on smartwebng but i will consider
    switching once my money expires. If the offer is still on by then,(sometime in
    august next yr), i will be more than willing to jump at it. once again, thanks
    n sorry i didnt reply

<p>I resumed for my last session of Uni  over a month ago. Its a little unnerving to look back now and see how much time has passed. Its been over four years but it sure doesn't feel that way.<br />
This session however, i have several things on my mind. For one, i have to prepare for my final project. I also have to make sure my grades are stellar so i don't drop or anything like that. All in all, i am in for one hell of an hectic session.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise therefore when i realized just today, that over one month is already  gone. This time thing has started playing tricks on me again. What happened to lofty ideas about making effective use of every second? where has the month gone? I can barely speak of achievements over the past month. Most noticeably, i still havn't made much head way with the project.</p>
<p>On realization however, I am poised to do something about my plight. I shall begin implementing those ideas and make dis year the best yet. Wish me luck :)</p>
<p>PS: Ubuntu 10.10 is now happily residing on my laptop and its excellent. It solves the only issue I've had for a while now; which is the suspend mode.</p>
