<p><em>These are a series of posts&nbsp;from my time working in the retail division of the Commercial department at a major Nigerian Telco.<&#47;em></p>
<p>This particular incident started a few days before I was to go on leave. We had just began selling a new ZTE Mifi after not having any MiFi in stock for quite a while even though it's a highly requested item. A couple of customers had come to complain that their Mifi wasn't functioning, even though it did so after purchase.</p>
<p>I always dreaded issues like those because the most common outcome was that the data purchased had been exhausted, and no customer wants to hear that, especially if they had only been using the device for a couple of days. This usually led to lots of angry customers calling us names and sometimes even getting violent. Its all part of the job though, so I proceeded to checking this particular customer's MiFi.</p>
<p>To my delight, I discovered that the data allocation was still almost intact. With that out of the way, I continued troubleshooting the issue, trying different SIM cards, different web browsers, disabling anti-virus, connecting the MiFi network to different devices from laptops to phones, etc. all to no avail.</p>
<p>At that point, I began getting frustrated and decided to call some colleagues at other centres to find out if they had encountered any such issue. I realised that they all had cases of customers complaining of similar issues, and the only common factor was that they had all purchased the new ZTE Mifi.</p>
<p>The device had been functioning just fine just a few days ago, so I knew it was not a factory defect. However, the same SIM that refused to work on the MiFi was working just fine when inserted into another device such as a USB modem. At that point, I just decided to try changing the DNS configuration and see what would happen.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, that worked. Once I changed the DNS settings on the laptop to Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4), I was able to access the internet again!. I was delighted and went ahead to change the DNS settings from the admin interface of the MiFi and sent the customer on his way.</p>
<p>I also informed my colleagues in other centres on what I did and they in turn made the changes for their clients.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a couple of days later, and I went on leave. As at my last day at work before the leave, the issue had still not been rectified. I was having to manually change the DNS config on every new MiFi I sold before handing it over to the customer.</p>
<p>I reasoned though, that someone must be aware of the issue, and it must have been fixed over the weekend before my leave began the following monday.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was not the case, and I had to put my colleagues in the office through on how to change the settings because customers kept coming back. Later that day though,&nbsp;I got a call from&nbsp;a colleague in Lagos who knew someone at&nbsp;the company that services the Telco's&nbsp;Network, who was aware of the issue and wanted more information. I explained to him how I did the troubleshooting and narrowed down the problem and my stop-gap solution to it.</p>
<p>He assured me that they were aware of the issue and trying to figure out a way to fix it. I thanked him and went ahead with my leave and by the time I returned, it had been fixed.</p>
