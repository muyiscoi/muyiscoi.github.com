excerpt: |+
  The gods are not to blame is a classic African (Nigerian) play by late renown Playwright Ola Rotimi. It is based on the classic Greek myth, Oedipus. Not having read the original Greek depiction, i cannot comment on how it relates or how this translates. However, I found the play very interesting and engaging (though i have never seen it on stage). I recently came across it again (it was recommended reading in JSS3) and decided to give it another read. I had forgotten about the treasure trove of Parables found throughout the book and found it to be very refreshing. I took note of all the parables and typed them out afterwards. They are listed below.

  If you are like me, and you love a good work of literature, i would recommend picking up this book. Even though you are not Yoruba, or Nigerian, or even African, you will really enjoy this book as its story speaks to you irrespective of your race.

  Enjoy.

  1. When the head of a household dies, the house becomes an empty shell.

  2. When the Chameleon brings forth a child, is not that child expected to dance?
