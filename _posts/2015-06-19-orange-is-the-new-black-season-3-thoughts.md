Like millions of others around the world, I spent the better part of last weekend and this week binge watching the latest season of the Netflix hit show &#8220;Orange is the new black&#8221; therefore stylised as &#8220;OITNB&#8221;.
  
I made a couple of observations about the overall theme of the show this season and felt I should try to organise those thoughts into a blog post here.
  
This season of OITNB continues the format of flashbacks giving us a background into the past lives the inmates. This season however, focuses quite a bit on religion, and herein lies my issue with the show.
  
It&#8217;s not surprising to think that lots of people in the US, especially in the show business industry probably have little or no believe or regard for religion. I have no issue with that. It doesn&#8217;t stop me from enjoying the movies/TV shows.
  
If you&#8217;re gonna depict religion in your work though, provide a balanced depiction devoid of bias. I feel this was not the case in this season of OITNB.
  
Without going into too much details, several religions were explored, almost all in the negative light with one notable exception. The religions explored in this season include Christianity, Amish, Nation of Islam, Judaism and some form of cult not clearly defined.
  
It seemed to me like all those other religions factored into the worst memories of the inmates and might have propelled them into becoming criminals, however, with Judaism, it was just the best thing!. The practitioners got to eat good food when the meals were changed, and it somehow miraculously changed one of the characters that was notoriously rude and arrogant into aÂ  whimpering pile of goo.
  
This to me is not a fair depiction. I&#8217;m not saying this was necessarily done on purpose. The show runners and writers might not have noticed anything here, and a cursory Google search for reviews of the season shows that most reviewers haven&#8217;t caught on to that trend as well.
  
Anyway, I just felt I should post my thoughts here on what I noticed. The show is still nice, although, this season probably wasnt the best. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll keep watching but I have a lot of time to make up my mind before the next season airs, so there&#8217;s that.
