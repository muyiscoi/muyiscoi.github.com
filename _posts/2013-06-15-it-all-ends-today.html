<p>I write this post to affirm a decision I have made and also to possibly inspire anyone mulling over such decisions themselves. For ages, people have seen me in a certain light, and have used that to decide what my capabilities are, however accurate. As a result, I allowed my story to be written for me by others based on how they saw me. I even went ahead to try to become what they thought I was, even though I knew deep down that's not who I am, and I'm not particularly good at, or interested in that stuff.</p>
<p>Today, all that came to an end.</p>
<p>I've decided not to define myself by how others see me but by how I&nbsp;perceive&nbsp;myself. If I don't tell you something about me or what I can do, do not expect me to be what you deduce me to be. Many people know a bit about a lot of things. Doesn't mean they are defined by their knowledge. I coin my own definition of myself, and that's the one that matters. No one else!.</p>
<p>What I am, is an evolving definition, nearing perfection. More to be revealed.</p>
