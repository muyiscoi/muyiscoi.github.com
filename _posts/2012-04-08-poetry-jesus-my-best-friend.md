[<img class="wp-image-334 aligncenter" title="best friend" src="https://muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/best-friend-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="195" />](https://muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/best-friend.jpg)_A few days before this past Valentines Day, I was tasked by my sister to write a poem for her to present at a val&#8217;s day program she was to attend. So, with her help, I was able to come up with what is below. I just decided to share it with the lot of you this season &#8216;cos the message is still relevant to easter. Enjoy._

Why wouldn&#8217;t he let me go
  
I don&#8217;t deserve his grace
  
For I am tattered and frayed
  
And full of life&#8217;s mistakes

<!--more-->I was running a race


  
but the pressures had been too great
  
And to them I fell prey
  
A dear price I had to pay

I had accepted my fate
  
Knowing I do not deserve a save
  
Crimson and dark with stains
  
Definitely beyond his grace

And yet here he is in my dreams
  
Patient, loving, caring and ready to save
  
He said he only needed my faith
  
So that I could escape the grave

He said his love is like the rays of sunshine
  
Piercing into the heart with light and warmth
  
He said his peace is like a river
  
Ever casting life&#8217;s cares away

He said I should come to him and abide
  
Cast all my cares and in him reside
  
For in him is new life
  
He said he will lead me to the cross

But all these have I heard before
  
When the deceiver came seeking an oath
  
Tongue rang with sounds so sweet
  
My soul being sought for the debt

Enticed, I surrendered and gave in
  
Naive, I presented my soul
  
Scared, I received the presents
  
Enraged, he took them all away

I returned broken and empty
  
My being shaken and shattered
  
My heart pierced and bitter
  
Soul belonging to another

And here you come
  
Asking me to surrender!
  
How can I trust your love
  
Why should I come to the cross?

The Cross

But I&#8217;ve heard about the cross
  
I heard itis a perfect symbol of love
  
Where my sins were washed away
  
That in it there can be no loss

The cross that freed me from every curse
  
Where you took away my shame
  
Where your pain has become my gain
  
Where you died so I could live

It has now become clear
  
I am now in love with another
  
A true love I have found
  
Nothing else matters

My peace returned like a flash of lightning
  
Swiftly, I ran into his arms, enveloped in his warm embrace
  
I love you, he said
  
Indeed no other love compares
  
For Jesus is now my best friend.
