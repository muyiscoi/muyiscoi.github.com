This has been an issue for as long as I can remember and I&#8217;ve had to develop means of overcoming it, and can now do so fairly successfully.
  
I am also Nigerian and grew up as part of a Yoruba family. Anyone that knows anything about the Yoruba people will tell you that we are big on one thing; respect.
  
The Yorubas value respect to an almost ridiculous extent. It&#8217;s not so much the thought of respecting your elders as the act of showing respect, whether you mean it or not.
  
There are many protocols and ways to show respect to different sets of people depending on their relationship to you. This ranges from special words to use when greeting them to postures to be taken during said greeting, etc. These words and postures differ based on several factors such as the person&#8217;s age, relationship to you, marital status, etc.
  
What does my issue with left and right have to do with being Yoruba you might ask? A lot actually.

You see, one of the major ways of showing respect is to always use your right hand when either collecting or giving something to your superior. It&#8217;s seen as a sign of disrespect to stretch out your left hand to an elder, and in some scenarios, can even be seen as an insult.
  
This became an issue for me pretty quickly, and the fact that I am left handed definitely didn&#8217;t help matters. I recall my mom having to correct me numerous times when friends and family members who came around during the festive season wanted to give me money and I would stretch out my left hand to receive it.
  
They would then have to apologise on my behalf just to be sure that the person did not think I did it on purpose.
  
It got to the point in my young mind that I decided something had to be done. I had to come up with a system for quickly identifying which hand was my right.
  
Like I said in the beginning, I now have a system that works, but I had to try several things before stumbling on it.
  
Initially, I felt that I should be able to instinctively tell which hand is my right if I thought about it, so I tried that. Suffice it to say, it didn&#8217;t work. I either ended up &#8220;instinctively&#8221; stretching out a hand at random, mostly the wrong one, or spent too much time thinking about it, to the extent that people started to notice. My dad noticed that whenever he wanted to give me something, I would pause for a bit and stare at both hands before finally stretching out the right (right) one. True to my dad&#8217;s playful manner, he started making fun of me about my predicament, and I decided I needed a better plan.
  
Another thing the Yoruba people believe is that the left hand is the dirty hand, i.e, its the hand you use to do dirty tasks such as wiping your bum after using the toilet, removing snot from your nose, etc. and as such should not be used for eating. Being left handed, I gravitated towards doing everything with my left hand from a really early age and my parents had the foresight to not force me to change like lots of parents did back then. There was however, something my mom could not compromise on, and that was eating Native meals such as _Amala_ and _Eba_. For those not familiar, those meals are traditionally eaten with the hand directly, and my mom couldn&#8217;t fathom me using my &#8220;dirty&#8221; hand to eat them, so I was forced to learn to eat with my right hand. Thankfully, all this happened when I was a toddler, and I have little or no recollection of it. However, I now had an arsenal with which to try my second method of telling left from right.
  
The system was that I would try to imagine myself eating, and then deduce my left and right hands from that. This system worked considerably better than the first one, and cut down on the time it took for me to figure out which hand was which but it was not without its flaws.
  
For one thing, my mom was only partially successful in her quest to get me to eat with my right hand. I use my right hand to eat Native meals, but I still used cutleries with my left hand. This meant that when I tried imagining myself eating, I sometimes imagined myself eating local meals, and at other times, using cutleries, and the whole thing became very confusing.

It was somewhere around this point that I came up the the third, and current method of telling left from right. Like almost everything else, I write with my left hand. This is something I do often, so its easy to imagine, as well as being consistent (since I don&#8217;t ever write with my right), so it doesn&#8217;t cause confusion. Once I began using this system, I noticed that things became exponentially easier, and I could more convincingly fake the ability to tell my left from my right effectively, like most other people can.

It&#8217;s still a bit of an issue though. If i&#8217;m asked on the spot, I would still struggle to give an answer on which is which, and I still catch myself second guessing which hand I put out at times. However, with the big things such as handshakes, giving or collecting things from people, etc. muscle memory has taken over and I don&#8217;t need to invoke my system to know which hand to use. I still need to use my &#8220;biro system&#8221; from time to time, but it&#8217;s becoming less frequent.

One more recent side effect of this is telling direction, and by extension, navigation. I am especially bad at navigating my way around a new city, and routinely get turned around when using stuff like Google Maps for navigation. I could walk a couple of blocks, turning left and right in several places, and on my way back, find it difficult to differentiate where I turned left from where I turned right. This is definitely getting better, and just like the &#8220;biro system&#8221;, I am coming up with ways of overcoming it.

Not being able to instinctively tell left from right isn&#8217;t really a big deal in the scheme of things and its definitely not something I have seen as any particular impediment to my development or success in any way. Its just a fun quirk that I have, as I&#8217;m sure lots of other people do, and I thought I should share it.
