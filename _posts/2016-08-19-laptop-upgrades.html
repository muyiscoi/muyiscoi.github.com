<p>I did this a while ago, and can't believe I haven't posted about it sooner.</p>
<p>I've had <a href="https://muyiscoi.com/?p=386">my current laptop</a> for almost 4 years now and while its still going strong, are getting a bit outdated. Since I can't afford to buy a new laptop at the moment, I decided to upgrade my current machine as much as I possibly can.</p>
<p>The first thing to do was to replace the 1TB Hdd with a 250Gb Samsung EVO850 SSD. Just doing this caused a very noticeable improvement to the speed of the machine. A couple of months later, I upgraded the RAM to 16GB (which is the maximum supported by the laptop) and took out the DVD drive, installing the 1TB HDD in its place.</p>
<p>I also replaced the power adapter and battery, but had to return the battery I got 'cos it was performing worse that the one originally on the laptop.</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm pretty happy with the machine. I would still love to get a newer machine in the future, but for now, my Laptop has a new (ish) lease on life.</p>
