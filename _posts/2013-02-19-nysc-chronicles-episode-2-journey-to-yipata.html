<p>The Bus made a scary whirring sound as the driver willed it to speed up along the highway. We had been on the road for about three hours already but still had several more to go.</p>
<p>Our journey had began at about 7:35am, after almost an hour of waiting for passengers to arrive. My parents dropped me off at the Rumuola park before 6:40am that morning. There wasn't even any sign it was morning yet as everywhere was still pitch black. That changed suddenly though, as less than fifteen minutes later, sunlight streaked into the decrepit looking park, illuminating all the buses and already tired looking faces of fellow travelers. I was on my way to Kwara state to resume at Yipata NYSC Orientation camp. Apparently, I wasn't the only one too as the bus terminal was full of other young faces whose expressions told the story their mouths had not yet gotten around to saying.</p>
<p>The bus I was to travel by was a typical 18 seater. It sat 14 passengers today, as the journey required a level of comfort that four passengers sandwiched on a row cannot provide. Traditionally, I like to be at the front seat whenever traveling because I'm a bit taller than most people. However, this was not to be the case, and I found myself having to set my leg in an awkward position between one of the seats and the sliding side door of the bus. I wasn't overly uncomfortable though, and if I didn't stay in one position for too long, I could even experience some level of comfort, at least for a little while before my leg starts cramping up.</p>
<p>I am no stranger to traveling long distances by road. In fact, for my first two undergraduate years, I traveled back and forth between school and home by road. This went on until I'd had enough and strong armed my parents into letting me fly. Flying wasn't an option here though. Believe me, I checked. There is an airport in Illorin but no flights plying the Portharcourt &ndash; Illorin Route. A different option would have been to fly to Lagos and then take a bus down to Illorin but that was just too expensive and doesn't save enough time to justify the cost.</p>
<p>So, I had no choice than to sit in the hot bus, constantly adjusting my position to prevent body cramps, willing the journey to end.</p>
<p>I eventually struck up conversation with a few of the other passengers and got to find out that all of us in the bus were corpers. A few of us were going to Osun state, and the rest, like me, were Kwara bound. We chatted about several small things and shared some of our past experiences with one another. All in all, we kept a pretty lively conversation going, so much that I forgot about the cramps in my leg and was able to relax for a long while.</p>
<p>About eleven hours after we began our journey, we arrived at Maraba park in Illorin to much excitement. Our joy was quickly quelled though when we discovered that the Yipata camp was another two to three hours away.</p>
<p>A few travelers decided to spend the night in Illorin and the Nigerian Christian Corpers Fellowship (NCCF) and other such groups were more than willing to oblige those people, ushering them to waiting vehicles that took them to lodgings for the night. I, however, intended to see things through. I had come this far, and so long as I could find a bus to take me to the camp, I would go, irrespective of how late it was.</p>
<p>So, that was how I found myself squeezed into the front seat of a "space bus", with another equally burly stranger, shouting unintelligible words, which I later ascertained as Igbo, into my ear as he conversed non stop with several other passengers behind us.</p>
<p>That journey to the camp from Illorin made the top 10 list of the most uncomfortable few hours of my life and I was eternally grateful when we turned a corner and I saw lights streaming from a large clearing with white dotted creatures moving back and forth.</p>
<p>A big sign to the right read &ldquo;Welcome to NYSC Orientation Camp, Yipata&rdquo;. I had never been so happy to alight down from a vehicle before. It was about 10pm.</p>
