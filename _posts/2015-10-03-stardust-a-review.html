<p><a href="http://muyiscoi.github.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_20151004_002529.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-857"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-857" src="http://muyiscoi.github.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_20151004_002529-580x773.jpg" alt="IMG_20151004_002529" width="580" height="773" /></a>I recently completed my second book by Neil Gaiman, Stardust. Its a fairytale for adults, with lots of familiar fairytale tropes, albeit with a bunch of stuff that might not be altogether appropriate for a younger audience.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-856"></a>The story begins in the village of Wall, which is literally the border town between Earth and Faerie, and all that separates them is a wall with a hole in it. The villagers of Wall do not cross into Faerie but for one day every 9 years, and every other time, guards are placed to guard the hole in the wall in order to prevent people going to the other side. Stardust follows the story of Tristan Thorn, son of Dunstan Thorn, who goes in search of a fallen star in order to prove his love to the lady Veronica, despite the fact that its pretty obvious to readers that Veronica has no interest in him, and is not worthy of his love.<br />
Turns out that Tristan's origins might not be as he thought, and even though were told right off the bat how he is conceived, he is completely oblivious to this fact, and later on, we find out that we didn't have all the information after all.</p>
<p>The story has stuff you come to expect from fairy tales such as wicked witches, princes, strange creatures, etc. It however, doesn't follow the common damsel in distress type story often found in classic tales.<br />
In the end, the story comes to a satisfying end, and ties up all major loose ends. I like the fact that the story wasn't afraid to kill off characters. I was also happy that it didn't dwell on too many ancillary details. Some bits of the story were just mentioned, in order to move the plot along without belabouring it too much.</p>
<p>Overall, Stardust is a really good quick read despite the fact that, as seems to be the trend with me these days, it took me way too long to complete.</p>
<p>After finishing the Stardust book, I watched the movie. I had seen it when it first came out but couldn't remember much about it. The first act of the movie closely mirrors the book with only slight deviations from the source material. In the second act, the movie diverges drastically from the book, with nary a similarity between the two. It morphs into a conventional action movie building towards a climax with a big fight scene at the end. At the end of the last act though, there's a brief return to the story in the book, before finally ending the movie.<br />
It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, however, in my opinion, it failed to capture the heart of what made the book great.<br />
The movie was definitely good fun, but I very much rather preferred the book story, as is often the case where books and their movie adaptations are compared.</p>
<p>With two Gaiman books under my belt, I'm considering continuing the trend, but for now, I might have to go back to some other titles I already own but haven't gotten around to reading yet. I'll come back to good old Neil Gaiman at some point though.</p>
