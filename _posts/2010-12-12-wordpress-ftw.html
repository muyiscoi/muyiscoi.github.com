<p>Back in September, when i started this blog, i commented on my decision to go with blogger and my eventual aim of moving to self hosted wordpress. You can read that original post <a href="http:&#47;&#47;muyiscoi.com&#47;blog&#47;2010&#47;09&#47;choosing-a-platform-blogger-vs-wordpress-com&#47;">here<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>It is with great joy and excitement that I announce that I have been able to scrape enough time to bring that to a reality. I have moved over all the posts and comments from Blogger to WordPress and installed the Disqus commenting system. I have also redirected the blogger url so if u try going to the old blog, it would bring you back here :). Go ahead, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.muyiscoi.com">try it<&#47;a>. You know you want to.</p>
<p>Over the course over the next few days, I will be working on the look and other aspect of this blog but it is here to stay. Also, expect some changes on the parent site soon.</p>
