<p>As part of my Masters Project, I have to compare OpenNebula and OpenStack cloud platforms.<br />
I was a bit apprehensive before starting, as I've only studied cloud platforms as a concept, and never actually used one as an admin. I've of course used AWS several times, and this site is hosted on Digital Ocean, but those are all from an end-user perspective.<br />
So far, I've implemented OpenNebula in the lab environment and run a bunch of tests on it.</p>
<p>The verdict is that I actually quite like OpenNebula. The documentation can get a bit confusing, but once you wrap your head around some key concepts, the rest start to make sense. The web UI "Sunstone" is practically full featured, so there's little need to use the command line if you don't want to.<br />
OpenNebula itself is a very powerful platform with advanced features like cloud bursting with public clouds including AWS and Azure, and auto scaling, but those features are exposed in a simple way to the end user.<br />
The powerful Virtual Data Centre (VDC) system allows one to segment out virtual system resources to different classes of users, as might be applicable in a large organisation with multiple<br />
business units.<br />
There are many more useful features available in OpenNebula, and I'm sure most of it will end up on my final report.</p>
<p>It's very evident though, that I am working with something that has gone through several iterations to become a  full featured Cloud computing platform suitable for any enterprise.</p>
<p>I'm now in the process of testing out OpenStack and will surely give a report on that as soon as I'm done.</p>
