So, I&#8217;m finally done with this book, and with that, the series. The only thing to look forward to now would be the movie!. I actually enjoyed myself reading this series. However, even though I gave the first two books a 4 star rating, i am giving this one 3 stars.

Although, it was a solid book and a somewhat befitting end to the story, I wasn&#8217;t feeling it at some places. For instance, the whole mood swings and behavioral ticks Katniss was having throughout this book grew tiring at a point. She is portrayed as somewhat clueless and yet somehow ends up doing the right thing when the time comes.
  
She also turns to something of a cold blooded killer, killing even a harmless civilian after invading her home. Peeta&#8217;s story is just one which I was a little angry about.It all turned out okay for him though so I can&#8217;t complain too much on that regard.

For me, the story was a little hard to follow at times. Take for instance, the time spent underground while they were trying to get to President Snow&#8217;s mansion. There were some places when I had to ask myself if they were still underground &#8216;cos I wasn&#8217;t getting an clues from what I was reading that they were, or weren&#8217;t. I just had to keep on reading until I came across something in the story that told me where they are and then I began reforming the mental picture of the story in my head and pick up from there.

Overall though, I enjoyed this story, and like the fact that it had a relatively happy ending. I didn&#8217;t think Prim had to die though, but that&#8217;s just me.

**Note:** _The book reviews I put on here are copied directly from my reviews on [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/muyiscoi). They are meant to be read by those who have actually read these books. If you donâ€™t really get what I am saying, that is most likely because you have not read the book I am reviewing. The rating I give the book should tell you if I recommend it or not._
