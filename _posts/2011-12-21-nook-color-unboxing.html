<p>Just took delivery of my brand new <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-color-barnes-noble/1100437663">Nook Color</a> over the weekend. I was  away and didn't have access to WiFi and as a result, couldn't do much with the device until today. I took snapshots of the unboxing though and they are in the gallery below. After playing with the device for about a week, i'll share my views on it. Suffice it to say, so far, I am loving a lot of things about it. More on that later. For now, enjoy the unboxing pics.</p>
