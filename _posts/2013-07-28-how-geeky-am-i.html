<p>I've got a confession to make. I'm a geek!. Yeah, but you already knew that didn't you?<br />
I still need to prove my geekiness from time to time though, most recently and prominently, in the Etisalat Geek Force Internship Contest. I am still participating in the contest at the moment at an undisclosed location in the heart of Lagos Island :D so I can't really say much about it on this blog. However, I thought I should post something up on this blog about it, if only to act as a mile marker of my life which I can look back on later cos everyone knows no one reads this blog but me. See what I did there?</p>
<p>In a bid to prove to the folks at Eti-baba just how geeky I am, I made two videos which came out pretty nicely. I thought I should post them here so whichever poor sod is reading this post can see them for himself and bask in my geekiness :).</p>
<p>Here you go!<br />

<p>Hopefully, I will share some more info and maybe some good news on the competition in the future, but for now, pacify yourself with these fine videos :D</p>
