This is just a quick update blog. I generally like to write a blog when I get a new gadget I like, and I just got a new one; The Pebble Time.

The Pebble time is a popular smartwatch that you can find out about with a quick google search. I like it a lot, and it might just reduce the amount  of times I get to stare at my phone to see if I have any new notifications, so that&#8217;s a definite plus.

I still like my swatch watch which I was gifted earlier this year, so I&#8217;ll have to figure out some kind of system for wearing both&#8230; probably not at the same time though :).
