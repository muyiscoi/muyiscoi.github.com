Last month, I finally took the second exam and final requirement to get my Linux+ certification. It took way longer than I wanted, bit glad I finally did it.
  
As a result of the Linux+, I also got LPIC-1 and Suse Linux certification.
  
The certificate and IDs for Comptia and LPIC finally arrived and I&#8217;m more pumped than ever to continue on this journey!
  
Not gonna let things take so long anymore though!
