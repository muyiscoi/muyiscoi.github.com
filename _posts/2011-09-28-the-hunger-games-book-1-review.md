The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a very nice and enjoyable book. I can see why so many people like it. It was a quick read and was definitely a pleasure for me especially since I just finished reading the gargantuan &#8220;The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear&#8221; (Book 2 of Kingkiller Chronicles) by Patrick Rothfuss prior to picking this up.

The Character of Katniss is a very compelling one and I soon got sucked into the world of The Hunger games. I would have happily given this book a full 5 stars rating if it had been a single book. However, for a trilogy, the ending was annoyingly anticlimactic. I expected some plot twist towards the end to make me run to the book shop to purchase the sequel. However, what I got left a lot to be desired.
  
I could read this book without knowing it were a series and be satisfied that it had come to an end. Now I know that in itself is not a bad thing for most people, but for me, I love my book series to have the continuous feel to them so that I have something to look forward to when I pick up the sequel.

In The Hunger Games, towards the end, we find out that Peeta is dying, &#8230; then he&#8217;s not; they might lose the games &#8230; then they win. The new ruling has been revoked and one of them has to die &#8230; then they figure out a way to defeat that too. They might not be as clever as they thought and might not get away with the stunt they pulled (and this is the biggest disappointment of all because they built it up so much) &#8230; and they still survive it. All the while, we knew Katniss didn&#8217;t have feelings for Peeta, then we began to hope, and even believe, only for it all to crash at the end. They won the games, left Capitol intact and got back home safely. End of book.
  
So I ask myself what else there is in the story. The only thing i can think of is that Katniss might take it upon herself to try and unseat Capitol and stop the Hunger games permanently.

Maybe the strategy used here is to make it seem like the story has ended and then release a sequel which would gnaw at the curiosity of the readers of Book 1 until they can&#8217;t help but pick up the sequel if only to see which story is left to tell in the world of the Hunger games.
  
I definitely know that I would be picking up the sequel but it would not be immediately after reading this. In the &#8220;KingKiller Chronicles&#8221; which I mentioned above, the suspense at the end of book 1 was so thick that I picked up the second book almost immediately, even though it is by far the largest novel I have ever read.

So, overall, a very nice book and I am looking forward to the twist the story takes in the sequels.

If you don&#8217;t really get what I am saying, that is most likely because you have not read the book I am reviewing. The rating I give the book should tell you if I recommend it or not._
