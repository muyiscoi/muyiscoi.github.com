I've been working as a Sysadmin for 1 year this week. While my title is Sysadmin, the work we do is a potpourri of multiple different fields from release engineering to site reliability engineering, to automation, developer support, Linux server administration, etc. The word "DevOps" can be thrown around if one wants, but that seems to have all sorts of definitions depending on who you ask, so I just keep things old school and stick to Sysadmin.
I've learned so much in this one year. I'm lucky to be working for a company that embraces modern technologies, so I've gotten to dig my hands into all sorts of fun stuff.
These are example of some of the technologies I've interacted with in the past year
* Docker
* Ansible
* Puppet
* Jenkins
* Python
* Openstack
* OpenSSL
* Elasticsearch
* InfluxDB
* Kafka/Zookeeper
* PostgreSQL
* Etcd, etc.

I don't know what its like for others in this field, but I've had the privilege of having great supportive colleages, who are willing to help and have taught me a lot.
Living and working in a different country has defintely been a challenge, despite the fact that I already had some experience in this from my time as a student. I had to move to a completely different part of the country for this job as well, and that was definitely an adjustment.
Overall though, its been a really interesting time. My expectations have definitely been met and exceeded.
I'm eagerly awaiting what another year has in store for me.
