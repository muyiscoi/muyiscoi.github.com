<p>Most readers of this blog (if any) might not know that this is just a part of the overall site. A main site used to exist which i just hacked together a while ago. However, I have discovered that, not only is that site not very visually appealing, it does not effectively convey the message I want. I have therefore decided to redesign the site. To give myself a sense of urgency, I have taken down the old site and put an "Under construction" message in its stead with a link to the blog. In the coming weeks, I will scrape together time to complete the new site and have it up and running. </p>
