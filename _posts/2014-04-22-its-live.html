<p>It's been a long time coming, but this past Sunday the CBC media team launched the Central Baptist Church Website over at http:&#47;&#47;centralbaptistchurchphc.org. It's a mouthful, I know. We're probably gonna have a shorter redirect for that in the future.</p>
<p>The site is built on joomla 2.5 with a premium template which has been heavily modified. It features several joomla for sliders, calendars, etc.</p>
<p>The site is still a work in progress as several pages are yet to bring filled. There is still lots to get done.<br />
Kudos to all the guys in the team for rushing to ensure we had something presentable for Sunday.</p>
