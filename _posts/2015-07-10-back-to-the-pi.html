</a><a href="https://muyiscoi.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pi1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-747" src="https://muyiscoi.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pi1-580x326.jpg" alt="pi" width="580" height="326" /></a>Since I'm on summer break now, I have more than enough time to go back to passion projects I have abandoned in the past. One of such projects is messing around with the Raspberry Pi.<br />
I won an amazon gift card a few days back and used it to purchase a Raspberry Pi2 and some accessories.</p>
<p>With it, I installed Plex Media Server and configured all my media collection on it with a 1TB USB 3.0 hard drive I've had for quite a while. I can now stream my media collection from wherever I am on my phone, laptop or iPad.</p>
<p>I also intended on setting up the Pi as a file server for storage and backup, but it appears that might not be such a good idea. When playing media from the pi, there's a lot of transcoding that goes on, and that could be quite CPU intensive. Adding yet another function for the device to do might be too much to handle.</p>
<p>Luckily, I still have one of my original Pi Model Bs lying dormant at the moment, and I intend on using that as the File/Backup server once I can get another external Hard Drive for it. In the mean time, I will set it up as a test server to implement cool linux server stuff and learn new things.</p>
<p>That's what the summer is for after all isn't it?</p>
