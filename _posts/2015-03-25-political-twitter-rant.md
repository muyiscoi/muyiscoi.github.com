So, I went on a bit of a rant over on twitter this evening, after reading a bit about our upcoming Presidential election this weekend, and for posterity sake, I decided to post it here as well.

Enjoy.

    I cannot vote as I am not in the country at the moment, and even if I was, I had decided not to vote for one basic reason

    I have no confidence in both candidates. I definitely do not want the incumbent back, and I am weary of deciding for the other party as well — Muyiwa Iyowu (@muyiscoi) <a href="https://twitter.com/muyiscoi/status/580822312414547968">March 25, 2015</a>

    Its all well and good to talk about wanting change, but change can go both ways. You can have a change that makes things worse

    When people try to convince me about why I should vote for Buhari, they mostly use the argument of wanting change. — Muyiwa Iyowu (@muyiscoi) <a href="https://twitter.com/muyiscoi/status/580822602073153537">March 25, 2015</a>

    So, basically, just for the fact that you want change, you have to vote for the other guy, since that&#8217;s the only option you have

    Thats a terrible argument in my opinion. You need to have something more important that your status as a challenger to be your selling point — Muyiwa Iyowu (@muyiscoi) <a href="https://twitter.com/muyiscoi/status/580822925051301888">March 25, 2015</a>

    Another reason people give for supporting Buhari is his Vice president. From experience,the vice president is mostly invisible to the public

    I can&#8217;t vote for a candidate solely based on the fact that I like his deputy. That&#8217;s just not enough!

    So, if you know in your heart of hearts that you lack the mental accume, or strong will to do the job, then why run for the position — Muyiwa Iyowu (@muyiscoi) <a href="https://twitter.com/muyiscoi/status/580824860479393792">March 25, 2015</a>
