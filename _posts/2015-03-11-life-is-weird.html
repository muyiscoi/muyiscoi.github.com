<p>I've been writing on this blog for quite a while now, and even though I've been very infrequent in updating it, going back through the archives, I get a pretty decent snapshot of my life over the past five years or so. I can see the stuff I was into that is still relevant to me, and the stuff that seemed to be in phases. I might not write a lot of personal stuff on here, but certain articles remind me of something totally unrelated to its subject matter.<br />
The only conclusion I can come to from all this is that life is weird. </p>

I don't think I could have anticipated where I am now five years ago in some respects. On the other hand, in other respects, it seems like I haven't moved an inch in five years. Locked in the same seemingly endless cycle.<br />
The advantage of having something like this to look back on is that I can now have an introspective look at things, and see where I need to make changes in my life.<br />
Being satisfied in who I am and in my abilities and capabilities is one important thing. The frank truth is that no matter how much I advance, there is much likely someone I know, probably a colleague from uni, or someone that just happens to be in the same age bracket as me, that is doing better. I don't have to measure myself against anyone else. Rather, I need to have a clear focus on where I'm going, and shun every other distraction along the way.<br />
Its easy for me to be blind to all I've been able to accomplish, because at every turn, I'm only seeing just how far away I seem to have become from some others. </p>
<p>I'm striving to make changes in my life. No more comparisons. Everybody has his/her life to live and I'm gonna live mine. No more striving to meet imaginary standards that I set for myself because they will never be attainable. </p>
<p>I need to realise what my strengths are, focus on them and capitalise on them. </p>
<p>Opportunities are not going to come to me without doing anything about them, so I'm taking the bull by the horn and seizing every opportunity I can find. No time to waste.<br />
I don't want to look back at this blog in another five years time and see missed opportunities and indecisiveness, cycle of low self esteem/confidence , etc. </p>
<p>I want to look back and see a chronicle of someone who has achieved the best of his potential and exceeded every limitation. </p>
<p>I want to become the best version of me I can be!</p>
<p>I will be!</p>
<p>I am!.</p>
