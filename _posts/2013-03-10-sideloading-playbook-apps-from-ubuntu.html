<p>Since switching over to an <a href="http://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=389">Ubuntu only install</a> on my laptop a few months ago, I've been wondering how I would side load apps on my<a href="http://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=345"> playbook</a>, cos the method I used required a java app running in windows. Since I didn't really have any app to side load at the time though, I didn't bother looking for a solution. Today, I finally had an app to side load and went about searching for an alternative method of side loading apps for playbook.<br />
I came across "<a href="http://gridbook.org/pb-app-mgr/">Playbook App Manager"</a>. Its an extension for Chrome or Firefox and it works wherever either browser works. I've tested it and it works really well. </p>
