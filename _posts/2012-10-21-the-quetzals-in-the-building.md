The latest version of my favourite Linux distribution,[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) 12.10 aka Quantal Quetzal ,was released last thursday. Despite my Internet connection limitations at present, I have been able to download a copy of the OS.
  
I&#8217;m eager to test out a lot of the new features I have read so much about and also experience the new additions that have made this release so controversial first hand. I would likely post my thoughts on the OS in due time but in the meanwhile, if you&#8217;re curious about the new version, an excellent review can be found over at [The Register](www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/18/ubuntu_12_10_review/).
