<p><a href="https://muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ThingsFallApart1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-99 alignright" title="ThingsFallApart" src="https://muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ThingsFallApart1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a> &ldquo;Things fall apart&rdquo; by Chinua Achebe undoubtedly holds a place on the  shelves of phenomenal classic literature in Nigeria. The protagonist,  Okonkwo, is a very colorful character; and the skillful mastery with  which the story is told keeps the reader hooked unto it until the end.<br />
There are several subplots in that book and one that really stuck to me was the story of Ikemefuna.</p>
<p>As an unassuming young boy,Ikemefuna was plucked from his home and  offered up to Okonkwo and his village (Umuofia) as a peace offering. His  village had murdered a girl from Umuofia and the penalty, in order to  avoid war was to give one boy and one girl from that village over to  okonkwo's village. The villagers quickly gave the girl over to the man  who lost his wife as a replacement, however, for ikemefuna, they did not  know what to do with him. That is how he found his way into okonkwo's  home.</p>
<p>One would think that such a child, knowing that whatever fate  eventually awaited him would not be kind, would wallow in depression and  self pity, or become a rascal, constitute a nuisance to society.  Ikemefuna, however, turned out to be just the opposite of that.</p>
<p>Within a few short weeks, he had gotten over his sadness and began to  contribute to the Okonkwo  household. Such was the impression he made  that Okonkwo, reputed for being hard and strict, took a liking to him,  albeit secretly. He then began influencing even other members of the  household; helping to mold Nwoye, Okonkwo's first son, into a man of  worthy character. Such was the respect he commanded in Okonkwo's  household that an incident involving a broken pot which might have  turned into a flogging session for the children involved was defused  with tact and wisdom.</p>
<p>One would begin to hope, maybe even believe, that this boy who is  full of life and obviously wants to live would be spared the evil fate  which had been looming over him since he came to Umuofia as a prisoner  of War. It took three years; however,<br />
unfortunately, there was not to be a happy ending for Ikemefuna as his fate was sealed and his execution pronounced.</p>
<p>The walk to death for ikemefuna was one filled with conflicting  emotions. On one hand, he must have feared that this was the end of the  road for him. On the other hand however, he had Okonkwo, the one whom  his has come to call &ldquo;father&rdquo;, here with him, along with the other men  of the village.</p>
<p>Surely. His &ldquo;dad&rdquo; would not let these men murder him; or would he?.</p>
<p>This pot of palmwine he is carrying on his head must mean something.  Doesn't it? The elders told him they were taking him back to his  village. Maybe that's actually what they are doing and the palm wine  would serve as an offering to the elders when they arrive.</p>
<p>It is most unfortunate that however we might wish it, the end for  ikemefuna came swift and sudden; the last blow, given by his &ldquo;father&rdquo;;  Okonkwo himself, for fear of being thought weak.</p>
