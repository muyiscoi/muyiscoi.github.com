As at 3pm today, my MSc programme officially comes to an end.

Its been one ofÂ the most enlightening experience of my life till date. I&#8217;ve been exposed both intellectually, culturally, emotionally, etc. I&#8217;ve developed a renewed confidence in my abilities and a better idea of what my strengths and weaknesses are.

I am very happy for the opportunity to go through this process, and even though there is a sense of dread now that there is no obvious next step for me, its an opportunity to look within and try to figure out what i really wanna do, and how to do so. Can&#8217;t wait to discover what that is!.
