So, I recently got a used Nexus 4 to test out the Ubuntu phone and more importantly, the &#8220;convergence mode&#8221; where the phone turns into a desktop OS when plugged into a monitor with a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard attached.
  
I&#8217;ve tested out an earlier incarnation of Ubuntu phone on the nexus 4, but this my the first time of trying out the convergence mode.
  
I gotta say, its still rough around the edges, but I was genuinely impressed. Although I understand that apps are supposed to change to adapt to the increased screen size, most still retained their phone look, with some notable exceptions such as the browser and media player. I&#8217;m sure these apps will be updated in due time though, so I&#8217;m not bothered.
  
The most glaring omission obviously is the dash. It looks exactly the same as on the phone, except that it&#8217;s running in a window. I assume the canonical guys are working on a new desktop version of the dash, so I&#8217;m not bothered. 

Anyway, without further ado, below r d images of d Nexus 4, running in convergence mode, connected to my 22&#8243; monitor via a slimport connector and a bluetooth keyboard/mousepad.
