<p>I read my news, particularly tech news via google reader on all me devices. I have the usual suspects added on there and check frequently for updates. Its super convenient and syncs across all my devices.<br />
The key to this working however, is that the sites provide the full content of their posts in the rss feed. Having to read a snippet of a post on google reader and then open up the full post on a new tab to read the rest is both frustrating and annoying. Thankfully, on the internet, there is always more than one source of the content you're looking for so if I add a feed and it turns out to be made up of post snippets, I remove it pronto and search for another site to give me what I need. The same thing goes for sites that I've been reading, which used to provide full feeds but then suddenly get it into their head to convert their feeds to snippets. Sorry, you gotta go. Nice knowing you. See ya later.<br />
I'm all for news blogs monetising and making money from all their hard work but that can still be done while providing full rss feeds. Ads can be integrated into the feeds as several sites currently do.<br />
So, today, I'm gonna have to remove yet another site cos I can't be bothered to click on the link to read the full story every single time. I hope others still on my list learn.</p>
