    Nice rhythms in the poem.

    I think you meant "a few days" not "a few says"

<p>Why wouldn't he let me go<br />
I don't deserve his grace<br />
For I am tattered and frayed<br />
And full of life's mistakes</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-333"></a>I was running a race<br />
but the pressures had been too great<br />
And to them I fell prey<br />
A dear price I had to pay</p>
<p>I had accepted my fate<br />
Knowing I do not deserve a save<br />
Crimson and dark with stains<br />
Definitely beyond his grace</p>
<p>And yet here he is in my dreams<br />
Patient, loving, caring and ready to save<br />
He said he only needed my faith<br />
So that I could escape the grave</p>
<p>He said his love is like the rays of sunshine<br />
Piercing into the heart with light and warmth<br />
He said his peace is like a river<br />
Ever casting life's cares away</p>
<p>He said I should come to him and abide<br />
Cast all my cares and in him reside<br />
For in him is new life<br />
He said he will lead me to the cross</p>
<p>But all these have I heard before<br />
When the deceiver came seeking an oath<br />
Tongue rang with sounds so sweet<br />
My soul being sought for the debt</p>
<p>Enticed, I surrendered and gave in<br />
Naive, I presented my soul<br />
Scared, I received the presents<br />
Enraged, he took them all away</p>
<p>I returned broken and empty<br />
My being shaken and shattered<br />
My heart pierced and bitter<br />
Soul belonging to another</p>
<p>And here you come<br />
Asking me to surrender!<br />
How can I trust your love<br />
Why should I come to the cross?</p>
<p>The Cross</p>
<p>But I've heard about the cross<br />
I heard itis a perfect symbol of love<br />
Where my sins were washed away<br />
That in it there can be no loss</p>
<p>The cross that freed me from every curse<br />
Where you took away my shame<br />
Where your pain has become my gain<br />
Where you died so I could live</p>
<p>It has now become clear<br />
I am now in love with another<br />
A true love I have found<br />
Nothing else matters</p>
<p>My peace returned like a flash of lightning<br />
Swiftly, I ran into his arms, enveloped in his warm embrace<br />
I love you, he said<br />
Indeed no other love compares<br />
For Jesus is now my best friend.</p>
