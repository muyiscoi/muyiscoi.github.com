I loved her before I met her
  
She was older but it didn’t seem to matter
  
I yearned for her to love me
  
But it seems her love had gone on a journey

I loved her when I met her
  
my eyes opened to view the world of her beauty
  
At that point I was overwhelmed with feeling
  
Nothing more perfect, the ignorance of not knowing

I love her now that I know her
  
Her green gown covering the dark <a name="AdBriteInlineAd_patches"></a>
  
Fiery eyes making light her gruesome injuries
  
Giving me sadness and a yearning to help her

I love her even though I now know her
  
I know her decay and rot and decadence
  
I know her degradation at the hands of detractors
  
I understand them all and yet I still love her

I love her but others love her too
  
They love her so much, they misplace her
  
They pillage and plow in a bid to waste her
  
I love her but others love to hate her

My love for her makes me want to help her
  
To deal with all the hatred and save her
  
I will do my part to hone and heal her
  
Cos she is my one and only Nigeria
