<p>This is just a quick update blog. I generally like to write a blog when I get a new gadget I like, and I just got a new one; The Pebble Time.</p>
<p>The Pebble time is a popular smartwatch that you can find out about with a quick google search. I like it a lot, and it might just reduce the amount  of times I get to stare at my phone to see if I have any new notifications, so that's a definite plus.</p>
<p>I still like my swatch watch which I was gifted earlier this year, so I'll have to figure out some kind of system for wearing both... probably not at the same time though :).</p>
