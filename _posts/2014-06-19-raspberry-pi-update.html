<p>So, it's been a while, and I thought I should post up an update to my travails with the Raspberry pi.<br />
Since I last posted about it, I've probably pivoted like twice on what I've used it for, but all that isn't important. What's important is what it's being used for at the moment.<br />
On a related note, one of the pi's died out on me recently. I blame the terribly inconsistent power supply and unstable power generating sets. It could just be that the SD card slot has a bent pin though. I haven't really had time to examine it, and all the lights still come up when I put it on, so I'm still hopeful.<br />
Since I have another pi and, for now at least, only need one, I'm not too bothered.</p>
<p>So, on to what I'm doing with it.<br />
I decided that using one pi only for xbmc and another as a file server was a waste, so I decided to combine both functions into one, and so far, it seems to work quite nicely.<br />
I am now running Raspbmc as the base distro, which is based on Raspbian, so I have a very familiar debian base to work with.<br />
Once I got xbmc up and running, doing all the updates and what not, I installed "XBMCtorrent" addon.<br />
XBMCtorrent basically does the same thing as Popcorntime, but it proceeds it. It works as you'll expect, and if you don't know what popcorntime is, Google it.<br />
Once I had that installed, I configured a static IP so I could SSH into the OS from my laptop.<br />
From console on my laptop, I did an apt-get update, installed samba and bit torrent sync.<br />
I then configured some folders to sync from my laptop to the external hdd connected to the pi. Again, if your unfamiliar with samba or bittorrent sync, Google it! :).</p>
<p>So, now, I've got a fully functional xbmc box with online media streaming capability via xbmctorrent, and local storage via the external hdd connected to it where I have my media collection properly indexed with metadata by xbmc.<br />
On the same box, I also have shared folder capability with samba, even to Windows boxes,  and Dropbox like syncing, albeit on a local network, across all my devices.</p>
<p>It's a pretty sweet setup that I'm sure I'll continue tweaking in the future, plus, now I have to look for something for the other pi to do, assuming it's still working of course.</p>
