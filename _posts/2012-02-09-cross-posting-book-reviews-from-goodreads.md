Traditionally, when I write a book review, I first do so on [goodreads](http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399799-muyiwa) and then create a post here and copy directly from my goodreads review, often adding only formatting to make it more presentable. Today, I stumbled upon a lesser known feature of goodreads whuch enables me to cross post my reviews right from goodreads.com to this blog once I publish it there. So from now on, all my book reviews would automagically appear on this blog too!
