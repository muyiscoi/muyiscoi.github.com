<p>This is one of the most common phrases that is heard throughout Nigeria. It translates to &ldquo;All will be better&rdquo; in English Language from the commonly spoken pidgin derivative. This simple phrase has become a mantra for most Nigerians and does well to mirrors our collective mind set.</p>
<p>The reasoning that all would be better when facing seemingly insurmountable odds is a natural human reaction. It can be found in people of all races throughout history in different degrees of intensity.</p>
<p>Africans and more specifically, Nigerians probably exhibit this trait more profoundly due to our innate belief in the supernatural and in a superior &ndash; all knowing being.</p>

<p>Before the colonial times, Nigerians, who engaged in traditional religions, always believed that every predicament they found themselves in was the will of their gods and that they were at the mercy of said gods. To this end, several elaborate and mostly misguided acts of appeasement were always carried out to temper the anger of the gods and restore them to their default state of optimism.</p>
<p>Several years after the introduction of "Western Religions", Predominantly Christianity, into African Society, the vigour of the traditional religions has been transferred over to the &ldquo;New Religion&rdquo;. It it therefore not surprising that Africa possesses the most people who identify with a religion and believe that their life is governed by it.</p>
<p>As Christians, we believe that prayers bring answers from God and so we do just that.</p>
<p>Luckily, Civilization has helped to reduce the prominence of ritual sacrifices and the like; which was the order of the day, to appease the gods of the traditional religions who were always angry for inexplicable reasons.</p>
<p>The predominantly religious nature of Nigerians has provided us with this high level of optimism which we see exhibited everyday. Many people from other parts of the world do not understand why Nigeria, though riddled with several problems, still has a very high percentage of people who believe that &ldquo;E go better&rdquo;.</p>
<p>My hypotheses that this behaviour is linked to religion is not based on the Nigerian experience alone. Back in the 1930s, Adolph Hitler had already gained power in Germany and made it abundantly clear that the Jews were no longer welcome. I cannot begin to understand how difficult it must have been for the Jews living in Germany at that time. Most of them had been there for generations and knew no other home. However, on hearing the news, I can guess that, if they spoke pidgin English, their response to that threat would have been &ldquo;e go better&rdquo;. This mindset must have remained in most of them, causing them to stay put in Germany, until it was too late.</p>
<p>Miracles do happen, and they sometimes do after all hope on the Physical has been lost. For a person who doesn't believe in the existence of God, and doesn't have faith on which to anchor, when he/she is faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, his &ldquo;faith&rdquo; which in this case would be in logic, science,others,etc., would be completely eroded and pessimism would kick in. In worst cases, he/she could lose all reason to live and commit suicide.</p>
<p>It is therefore to our advantage as Nigerians that we are overly optimistic even in the face of insurmountable odds. We as a people would not have survived decades of bad governance and other forms of degradation in social, political, economic, financial and other sectors were it not for our ever present mantra; &ldquo;e go better&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hopefully, soon, we will experience the realization of this mantra.</p>
