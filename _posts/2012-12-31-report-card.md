<a href="https://www.muyiscoi.com/?attachment_id=427" rel="attachment wp-att-427"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-427" style="border: 0px none; margin: 10px;" alt="report20card" src="https://www.muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/report20card-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>As we journey into the new year, I would like to take some time out to grade myself on events and activities, as well as developments throughout the year.
  
I have grouped these into specific categories, in order to make it easier to do, and read. Even though this post is called &#8220;report card&#8221;, I won&#8217;t be giving myself a grade, cos&#8230; well, that would just be redundant. A student doesn&#8217;t grade his own papers.
  
So, without further ado, here it is.

**Writings:
  
** I begin with this because, I have always [loved to write](https://www.naijastories.com/author/muyiscoi/). 2012 wasn&#8217;t a particularly exciting year in this department though. For reasons which i&#8217;m not entirely sure of, I didn&#8217;t really write much this year. Yes, I have a [smattering of blog posts](https://www.muyiscoi.com/?s=2012&x=0&y=0) through most of the months in the year, however, as for creative writing I can be proud of, I can only think of [one](https://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=333), and that was written way back in February. I need to do better!.

**Gadgets:
  
** Having always had a love for shiny gadgets (who doesn&#8217;t?), there definitely has to be a category for this. I began 2012 with 3 gadgets I can be proud of. I had my trusty HP Pavilion dv5 which was already showing signs of wear after over two years of use, as well as my brand new [Barnes and Noble Nook Color](https://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=196). I also just acquired my first smart phone, a Samsung Galaxy Fit. All in all, I was in pretty good shape gadget wise going into 2012, with Laptop, Tablet/Ereader and Smartphone all covered.
  
As for 2012 proper, by April I added to my smartphones by purchasing a Blackberry Curve 9300.
  
Sometime in July, my beloved Nook Color was stolen (long story), and I was left tablet-less. By August though, I acquired the [Blackberry Playbook Tablet](https://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=345). To cap it all up, in december, I purchased a new [laptop](https://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=386) to replace my aging, and now failing, HP Laptop.
  
All in all, 2012 was a pretty good year for me gadget wise. Hoping 2013 would be much better.

**Achievements:
  
** Its a little bit difficult writing this part cos its hard to know what can be classified as an achievement or not. Anyway, here goes.
  
In march, I went in for my NYSC service year (which is still on going) in Kwara State. I&#8217;m in charge of teaching computer science to over 300 students, and that&#8217;s just SS2. Suffice it to say, its a pretty big school!.
  
In July, I got into my first elected position of leadership as the PRO of our little community of corpers.
  
In October, I got elected as the CLO (Corper Liason officer) of the same group of corpers.
  
That&#8217;s about it I think. Pretty scanty. Definitely have to do better in the new year!.

**Family:
  
** Lots of stuff happened on the family front but since a large number of it didn&#8217;t happen to me, I&#8217;m not at liberty to broadcast them on the web. However, I can say that I got a new nephew this year!. That&#8217;s pretty cool. The family&#8217;s getting bigger everyday.
  
I&#8217;m sure 2013 be even more epic family wise!.

**Highlights:
  
** Highlights of the year 2012 for me are stuff like going for orientation camp in Yipata, Kwara State, becoming CLO, learning lots of new stuff, making lots of new friends (and a few enemies), my blog [getting hacked](https://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=383), etc. Yes, I was hacked. Don&#8217;t believe me, here&#8217;s a [pic](https://www.muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_00000086.jpg) of my site while &#8220;under seige&#8221; :D.

I think that about does it for the report card. Lots of other things, important and not so important, happened in 2012 which are not listed above. However, this should provide an appropriate primer into my 2012.
  
Onwards and upwards then!.
