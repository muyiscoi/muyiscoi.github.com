Most of you probably know that I am currently doing my Service year (NYSC). I should be rounding up in about two months time. I have decided to chronicle my service year as best as I can remember, trying to make it as witty as possible, while passing across the realities of the experience. This post is to provide a preview of what to expect.

There will be lots of images and text (obviously). I plan on separating the posts into chapters (or something of the sort), dealing with the different phases such as the Orientation Camp, PPA (Place of primary assignment), POP(Passing out parade), and everything in between.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;m probably going to start publishing them on this blog after my POP.<br /> While I develop the stories, you can console yourself with this picture of me at camp. Enjoy!. :D.
