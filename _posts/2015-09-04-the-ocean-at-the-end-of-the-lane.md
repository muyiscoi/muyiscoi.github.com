This is not my first Gaiman book, however its the first one I actually finished reading. I first tried reading &#8220;American Gods&#8221;, one of his most well known and critically acclaimed titles, but for whatever reasons, I wasn&#8217;t able to get through it and eventually gave up trying. Because of this, I went into this book with some trepidation, but people keep telling me that Neil Gaiman is one of the best out there, so I felt I should give him another try&#8230; and boy am I glad I did!.

<!--more-->The story is both simple and complex, straightforward and layered. Taken at face value, its a very nice story, albeit written a bit like a kids book, but if you give it a bit more thought, there are a lot of hidden stories in there, allusions to stuff that I haven&#8217;t even figured out yet.

As you can probably tell by now, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and since its such a small book, I&#8217;m probably gonna read it again before too long.
  
I won&#8217;t go into too much detail about it, &#8216;cos it&#8217;s probably better to go into the story knowing little to nothing about it (as I did).

On another note, I&#8217;m happy to be reading again. Its always something I&#8217;ve been able to do for as long as I can remember, despite the state or mood that I was in.
  
I was beginning to feel like I had lost that &#8216;cos for the past year or so, I haven&#8217;t really read much, and even some books I started had been abandoned along the way. I guess I just need the right story to get sucked right in to and forget everything else around me.

Finally, for my non existent readers, If you love quirky but simple stories that make you think, If you love fantasy that is not too fantastical but instead rooted in stuff you can relate to, If you love Neil Gaiman, and most importantly if you love good writing, get this book!. You will not regret it.
