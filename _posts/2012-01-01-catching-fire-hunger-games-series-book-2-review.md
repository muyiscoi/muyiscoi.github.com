_Catching Fire is the Book 2 of the Hunger Games Series. To see my review of the Book 1, Hunger Games, click [here](http://muyiscoi.com/2011/09/the-hunger-games-book-1-review/)_

After reading book 1 of &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; series, I was wondering what story was left to tell. Sure, they were all still under the capitol&#8217;s rule and nothing had really changed much, but it seemed like there was no loose end left to tie and the story had come to an acceptable, albeit anticlimactic end. This, in an odd way, made me want to read the sequel even more and after fighting the urge for a while, I gave in and picked it up.

A couple of pages into &#8220;Catching fire&#8221;, I began to grasp what the story was gonna be about &#8230; or so I thought anyway. There were rumours of rebellion and the catalyst was Katniss and Peeta&#8217;s rebellious acts during the Games. About halfway into the book, I realised that there was going to be yet another games, and even worse, this new games would feature Katniss and Peeta as contestants again. At this point, I was disappointed. I closed the book and didn&#8217;t look at it again for quite a while.

You might be wondering why then this book gets a 4 star rating from me. The reason is, after about two weeks, I picked it up again. I had lost most of my initial anger but still knew that I didn&#8217;t like where the story was going. I am not one to read a book halfway and abandon it forever though so I picked it up in order to complete it. I was pleasantly surprised when I began to enjoy the story again. Although there was gonna be another hunger games, it was nothing like the first one. The contestants were much more mature and the agenda was not just kill or be killed.

Finally, unlike the first book with its anticlimactic ending, this book ends the way all books that are in the middle of a series should; with lots and lots of suspense. It leaves the reader wondering, first of all, just how powerful district 13 is, if peeta is still alive, what role katniss will still play in the rebellion, and if the rebellion will even be successful or not.

I will definitely be picking up the third book. Can&#8217;t wait to see how this all ends.

If you donâ€™t really get what I am saying, that is most likely because you have not read the book I am reviewing. The rating I give the book should tell you if I recommend it or not._
