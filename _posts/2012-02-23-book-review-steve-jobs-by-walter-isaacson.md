My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/234980638)

Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is one of the best written works of non-fiction I have ever read. If I were to base this review on the writing alone, it would get a 5 star rating easy. However, the content also has a part to play.

To put it quite subtly, Steve Jobs led a colourful life. He was a hippie (not even of the more mission oriented yippie variety). He was also quite spoiled as a child and the adults around him condoned and even sometimes encouraged his eccentricities and idiosyncrasies. As a result, he developed a sense of being able to do anything without facing the repercussions.

He had a brilliant, analytical and creative mind. His knack for finding the right people for the job and being able to bring out the latent potential of his staff made him the success he was.

This book exposes lots of the lesser known facts about Steve Jobs and also gives context and depth to the more popular stories.

In this book, you see a man who followed his beliefs and sometimes, even in the face of concrete evidence against whatever he wanted to do, went ahead and did it anyway.

Reading this book shows you that, although Steve Jobs receives most of the public&#8217;s praise and sometimes scorn for the outcome of Apple&#8217;s products, there are several talented people working behind the scenes who actually bring these products to life, all the while having to put up with constant verbal abuse from Steve.

I commend the author for giving a balanced, unbiased take into the life of one of this century&#8217;s greatest visionaries and largely leaving the task of coming up with an opinion of the subject to the reader.

Whatever conclusions one might come to about Steve Jobs after reading this book, I believe that his whole demeanor and personality quirks, coupled with the legendary &#8220;reality distortion field&#8221; may have been the right ingredients, in the exact proportions to enable the kind of global impact which he was able to create throughout his lifetime.
