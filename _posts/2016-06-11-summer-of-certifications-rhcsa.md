(300/300). Â I was a bit worried as I had not written any lab based certification exam before. I was doubly worried after taking the exam as I just about ran out of time and could not adequately test everything. It all worked out in the end.

With this exam, I&#8217;m kicking off the Summer of certifications!. I haven&#8217;t decided on which one to do next, or that there will even be a next one, so it might turn out to be the &#8220;summer of a certification&#8221; in the long run. I&#8217;m eager to do more though, so we&#8217;ll just have to see how it goes.

In the mean time, I&#8217;m super excited about my new certification and happy to brag about it for a little while longer before looking for a new challenge to tackle.
