Every so often, someone, usually a relative, gets in touch with me to ask about something technology related. They usually ask about issues they or their friends are having, or devices they or their friends want to buy. I like to believe that I have always given good counsel, most of the time having to do lots of research myself because, unlike what they think, I am not a repository of knowledge on everything techy.

Today is like one of those days. I was contacted by my sister via Whatsapp about a friend who wanted to purchase a laptop. I asked her a few questions about what her friend would use the laptop for and proceeded to provide a list of specs to look out for. When I got to &#8220;Operating System&#8221;, I instinctively wrote down &#8220;Windows 7&#8221; but then I remembered that Windows 8 would be out in a few months and the guy might want to wait for that.
  
That was when the uncertainty began. Windows 8 is such a drastic change from the norm that it might just be too much change too soon for most people coming from any other earlier version of windows. Should I recommend that this guy wait for Windows 8, or atleast purchase a laptop that would get a free upgrade to Windows 8 and risk tainting my stellar &#8220;recommendation reputation&#8221; if he doesn&#8217;t like it, or should I stick to the tried and tested Windows 7? Eventually, I recommended Windows 7 for the guy and left it at that, afterall, Windows 8 isn&#8217;t even out yet.

I guess all I&#8217;ve been saying boils down to one point. What would be the reaction of the average Joe out there to Windows 8? The ones that haven&#8217;t been following its development and know nothing of the Metro UI. The unsuspecting accountant who hears about an update to the OS on his home computer and goes ahead to buy it only to be presented with a screen filled with brightly coloured boxes and constantly changing images?.
  
Would his first instinct be to look for a way to go back to what he had before or would he decide to give it a chance and grow to like it? Only time will tell I guess and all we can do for now is speculate.
