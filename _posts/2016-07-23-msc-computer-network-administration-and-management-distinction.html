<p>On Wednesday, 20th July 2016, I was officially awarded with a Masters degree in Computer Network Administration and Management from the University of Portsmouth, where I graduated with a Distinction.</p>
<p>Its been a journey that started since January 2015 and has taken a lot of blood and sweat, but I'm excited to be here. Its the end of a chapter that I started with a lot of trepidation, and for which I am very happy to have embarked upon.</p>
<p>There are several people, especially members of my immediate family who have helped in not insignificant way to see me through this program and to them I am eternally grateful.</p>
<p>As for what I'm gonna do next, only time will have to tell. For now, I will continue exploring all opportunities available to me, learn and improve my knowledge and try to be open and receptive to more new experiences.</p>
