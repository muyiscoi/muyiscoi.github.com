[<img class="size-medium wp-image-99 alignright" title="ThingsFallApart" src="https://muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ThingsFallApart1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />](https://muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ThingsFallApart1.jpg) “Things fall apart” by Chinua Achebe undoubtedly holds a place on the shelves of phenomenal classic literature in Nigeria. The protagonist, Okonkwo, is a very colorful character; and the skillful mastery with which the story is told keeps the reader hooked unto it until the end.
  
There are several subplots in that book and one that really stuck to me was the story of Ikemefuna.

As an unassuming young boy,Ikemefuna was plucked from his home and offered up to Okonkwo and his village (Umuofia) as a peace offering. His village had murdered a girl from Umuofia and the penalty, in order to avoid war was to give one boy and one girl from that village over to okonkwo’s village. The villagers quickly gave the girl over to the man who lost his wife as a replacement, however, for ikemefuna, they did not know what to do with him. That is how he found his way into okonkwo’s home.

One would think that such a child, knowing that whatever fate eventually awaited him would not be kind, would wallow in depression and self pity, or become a rascal, constitute a nuisance to society. Ikemefuna, however, turned out to be just the opposite of that.

Within a few short weeks, he had gotten over his sadness and began to contribute to the Okonkwo  household. Such was the impression he made that Okonkwo, reputed for being hard and strict, took a liking to him, albeit secretly. He then began influencing even other members of the household; helping to mold Nwoye, Okonkwo’s first son, into a man of worthy character. Such was the respect he commanded in Okonkwo’s household that an incident involving a broken pot which might have turned into a flogging session for the children involved was defused with tact and wisdom.

One would begin to hope, maybe even believe, that this boy who is full of life and obviously wants to live would be spared the evil fate which had been looming over him since he came to Umuofia as a prisoner of War. It took three years; however,
  
unfortunately, there was not to be a happy ending for Ikemefuna as his fate was sealed and his execution pronounced.

The walk to death for ikemefuna was one filled with conflicting emotions. On one hand, he must have feared that this was the end of the road for him. On the other hand however, he had Okonkwo, the one whom his has come to call “father”, here with him, along with the other men of the village.

Surely. His “dad” would not let these men murder him; or would he?.

This pot of palmwine he is carrying on his head must mean something. Doesn’t it? The elders told him they were taking him back to his village. Maybe that’s actually what they are doing and the palm wine would serve as an offering to the elders when they arrive.

It is most unfortunate that however we might wish it, the end for ikemefuna came swift and sudden; the last blow, given by his “father”; Okonkwo himself, for fear of being thought weak.
