(300&#47;300). &nbsp;I was a bit worried as I had not written any lab based certification exam before. I was doubly worried after taking the exam as I just about ran out of time and could not adequately test everything. It all worked out in the end.</p>
<p>With this exam, I'm kicking off the Summer of certifications!. I haven't decided on which one to do next, or that there will even be a next one, so it might turn out to be the "summer of a certification" in the long run. I'm eager to do more though, so we'll just have to see how it goes.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I'm super excited about my new certification and happy to brag about it for a little while longer before looking for a new challenge to tackle.</p>
