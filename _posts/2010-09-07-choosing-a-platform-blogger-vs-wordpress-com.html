  content: I personally prefer wordpress to blogger mainly because wordpress is much
    more open* and does not lock you in. It is very easy to import any blog framework
    (blogger,typepad etc) into wordpress and it is also easy to do a self hosted blog
    9which is what I use) on wordpress. Beside that wordpress is the android of blogging
    ( I was gonna say even the iPhone) due to the huge numbers of 3rd party add-ons
    (themes and extensions) available for it. I don&#039;t know much about the cost
    of having a personalized blog on wordpress. But I do favour the self hosting path
    due to the amount of knowledge and experience and control it brings to me when
    it comes to hosting my own site

  content: "@bigbrovar i agree with you totally. a major issue i&#039;ve been having
    is moving the commenting system over to disqus. it is very straightforward with
    wordpress but requires hacks (like almost anything else) in blogger. i will eventually
    move this blog over to a self hosted with wordpress"

  content: Nice. I hope to blog on my own domain in the near future but have not even
    gone into any research on that. Your post and the comments are insightful. Your
    resume is killing me. Quite frankly,im jealous.

  content: thanks. Isaac. It&#039;s not that hard to own a site. People just don&#039;t
    know. I guess ignorance is the major issue. I&#039;m glad you like my resume.
    Hope employers like it too :D

<p>I am in the process of creating a full featured website for myself. I intend to do this with as little spending as possible on my part. However, i want to achieve a professional output. This means that when it comes to my blog, it had to be on my domain and not be a link to a blog hosted on blogger or wordpress.com. My domain name is registered with a very cheap plan however (see comment about spending above) so i did not want to create a self hosted wordpress blog because of the fear of exceeding my monthly bandwidth. I then began researching on how to have my blog hosted on wordpress.com or blogger servers but redirect to my subdomain. It turns out that this is possible for both parties. I actually leaned more to wordpress by default (being opensource and all). I went right ahead and created a blog on wordpress.com and proceeded with finding specific instructions on how to go about redirecting my subdomain which i had recently created. After finding the info, i proceeded with applying it to my newly created blog only for me to hit a massive brickwall. I had to shell out $12 for that feature. After the initial WTF! reaction, i reasoned it again and my thoughts began to resonate with the wordpress.com guys. Afterall, they weren't a charity. They had to make their money somehow. Up until then, i didnt know how they actually did it but i guess i had figured out one of the ways. Me being the cheap ass student that i am, i quickly closed that tab, opened another, and typed in the URL for blogger. I know that blogger belongs to Google and being the all round do-gooders that they are, i wanted to believe that thier version of the redirect service will be free ... and it is. So, i proceeded with ressurecting my dead blogger blog which had remained dormant for over a year and a few hours of tweaks and hacks later, i had it looking fairly recent and i was ready to redirect. I have done that now and d URL is loading google.com instead of my blog. However, that seems to be a normal thing as the DNS has to resolve or something like that and that could take a day or more. So, i undid it in order to post this and i will redo once i am done. Fingers crossed :).</p>
