While trying to repartition the harddrive, I succeeded in royally messing up the Windows 8 installed on it!. I don&#8217;t want to go into exact details on how this happened but, suffice it to say, it did and I was pretty messed up about it as you might imagine. You see, I also messed up the recovery partition and since I didn&#8217;t have the foresight of creating a recovery disk, I was now without a way of reinstalling Windows 8 on my spanking new machine.

I had previously dual-booted [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) on it however, and that partition was still intact so I performed a [Boot Repair](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair) and had a bootable OS on my Laptop. I have been using Ubuntu on my Computers for about 5 years now (began with Ubuntu 7.04 way back in 2007). I have however, always installed it alongside windows. There have been several reasons for this.
  
In the early days, not everything worked properly; in fact, the touchpad didnt even work on my Hp 500 Laptop with Ubuntu 7.04 until I did a kernel update. So, I was skeptical about taking the plunge. I was also very new to the OS and didn&#8217;t want to doom myself while learning something new. Thirdly, I was still in school and required Windows for some applications such as MatLab, [Proteus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus_%28design_software%29), and of course Microsoft Office.

Fast forward 5 years and I am no longer a novice Ubuntu user, In fact, in some circles, I am considered a bit of an expert ðŸ™‚ . I am also no longer in the University (atleast for now) and whatever app I need for work or learning is available or has a capable alternative on Ubuntu. I however, still dualboot my laptop. I always dreamed of a time when I would have only Ubuntu on my Laptop but that day just didn&#8217;t seem imminent.
  
When this new device landed, I didn&#8217;t hesitate to do what I&#8217;ve always done. Shrink the Windows partition, Install Ubuntu on some of the space, and leave the rest as a neutral partition for &#8220;Stuff&#8221; shared by both Ubuntu and Windows. Even though I no longer really &#8220;needed&#8221; Windows, I didn&#8217;t want to just discard it, especially since it had contributed to the overall cash I just plopped down for my new baby.

With the way things turned out though, I was left with only Ubuntu on my machine and after doing some research, I learned that I would have to delete the harddisk&#8217;s partition table before I could reinstall Windows because of the drive using [GPT style partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT_Partition).

All this just made me think about what I really needed windows for, and for now, the answer is, nothing really. I can do just about anything I want using Ubuntu. My gaming doesnt exceed a few sessions of Solitaire or Sudoku so I don&#8217;t need windows for that either. Windows 8, from the little I used of it before I borked everything, didn&#8217;t make a really good case for itself and I&#8217;ll much rather prefer my full screen apps on devices that are better suited for them. It all dawned on me that this would be a really good time to do what I&#8217;ve always dreamed of doing; having only Ubuntu installed on my machine.
  
So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing :D.

I formatted the partition that was supposed to have windows and I&#8217;ve installed a Windows 7 VM in there via virtualbox. Now, I know what you&#8217;re thinking; this dude just said he doesnt need windows and now he&#8217;s installing it in a VM. The fact is, you never know. I might need to do something that can only be done on Windows (wonder what that could be) and would rather have a Windows VM already setup and ready to go than have to set one up at a moment&#8217;s notice.
  
So, I have a new laptop (which I like very much by the way), and its running only one OS, Ubuntu 12.10 64bit version.

Since I am not doing this out of any sense of [freedom (as in free speech)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) or [Opensource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) idealology, but just because I think Ubuntu is a superior OS, I am leaving the option of reinstalling windows on my laptop open for now. I&#8217;m considering purchasing a Windows 8 pro license ($99) and just keeping it for such an occasion. If i do decide to do that, it&#8217;ll be while upgrading to Ubuntu 13.04 next April!.

Watch this space&#8230; if you like :D.
