After a quick search, I came across [Parole Media Player](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/parole/).

_Parole is a modern simple media player based on the <a title="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" rel="nofollow">GStreamer</a> framework and written to fit well in the <a title="http://www.xfce.org" href="http://www.xfce.org" rel="nofollow">Xfce</a> desktop._
  
 _It is designed with simplicity, speed and resource usage in mind.Â _

Even though it is written for the Xfce Desktop, Parole integrates perfectly into the Unity desktop, since they rely on a lot of the same dependencies. It has a simple interface and since it uses the GStreamer backend, supports virtually any audio or video format you can think of. Most importantly, I haven&#8217;t experienced any of the annoyances of Totem while using it.

There are a few missing features such as the ability to a video resume from last played position, keyboard shortcuts for controlling audio volume within the app, etc. Development of the app is quite active, so I&#8217;m sure these features and more would be added soon. Overall, I am happy with this app and it has already replaced Totem on my Ubuntu 13.04 install.
