<p>The latest version of my favourite Linux distribution,<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> 12.10 aka Quantal Quetzal ,was released last thursday. Despite my Internet connection limitations at present, I have been able to download a copy of the OS.<br />
I'm eager to test out a lot of the new features I have read so much about and also experience the new additions that have made this release so controversial first hand. I would likely post my thoughts on the OS in due time but in the meanwhile, if you're curious about the new version, an excellent review can be found over at <a href="www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/18/ubuntu_12_10_review/">The Register</a>.</p>
