I recently graduated from University and as is well known of the School I attended, the use of Mobile Phones is strictly prohibited. As you can imagine, being the technophile that I am, this was more than a bit frustrating.

I soon got used to it though, and eventually was able to fill the void, albeit partially, with devices such as the Apple iPod Touch.

The weeks leading up to graduation day, when the prohibition on the use of mobile phones was lifted for the final year students saw most of us indulge ourselves by purchasing that device which had plagued our fantasy for so long. The most common culprit were the Blackberry devices.

I unfortunately, live in a city far away from school and this prohibited me from making any purchase (that and of-course the lack of cash :D).

On getting back home after all the festivities, I began considering the device i could buy which would be befitting of my status as a newly graduated technophile. Obviously, any RIM device wasn&#8217;t even up for consideration (If you don&#8217;t know why, never mind ðŸ™‚ ). I eventually settled on the Nokia C7. It is a mid level smartphone from Nokia and has everything I want in a phone, except maybe its outdated User Interface. Then came the time of pricing. I went to find out how much the Nokia C7 cost and was told it was 54,200 Naira!!.

\*\*Reality check\*\*. I don&#8217;t have that kind of money! Fresh graduate that I am!, even if I did, there are much more important things i need to buy.

My plan was abruptly put on hold. I went back home, picked up my mom&#8217;s dual Sim Tecno &#8220;china&#8221; phone and began using that. I slugged about with that device for a couple of weeks until my mom, who absolutely loves flip phones, got a new flip to replace the old one that got damaged, and gave me the phone she had been using in the interim.

I was now a proud owner of a Nokia 7230 slide handset rinning Series 40 (S40) OS.

At first, I was not in the least impressed by this device. It had a sleek look to it, and was quite small so I thought, at least, I would have a stylish phone.
  
On deeper examination, I became more and more impressed with the phone.

**What impressed me about this phone**

First of all, it is a 3G phone. A 3G PHONE!!. I mean, this is a relatively cheap feature phone and has 3G. That blew my mind. Even my sister&#8217;s Blackberry doesn&#8217;t have 3G and she complains about that whenever she sees someone browsing with a 3G enabled phone. That doesn&#8217;t really mean anything to me though as my network of choice, Etisalat, has probably the best data service in my area in terms or reliability, but doesn&#8217;t support 3G yet.

Secondly, it has an FM radio receiver. Now I know what you&#8217;re thinking; this is a standard feature on most modern phones right? well, wrong. For some strange and inexplicable reason, a lot of modern and high end smart phones (I am looking at you iPhone) do not have an FM radio receiver built in. This is not only frustrating but annoying as well.

To describe the third reason why IÂ  like this phone, I need to give a little background information.

My needs are relatively simple in a mobile device. Yes I love to test them and push them to their limits but after all that, the day to day activities I use it to carry out are pretty basic.

**My basic requirements of a mobile device**

  1. I must be able to make calls with it if it is a phone (well duh!)
  2. I should be able to play basic games on it (Solitaire, Sudoku, etc.). I don&#8217;t have much patience for games unfortunately and can never quite bring myself to slug through angry birds or the like for any respectable length of time.
  3. I must be able to read on it. I am a voracious reader of fiction (Novels) and I prefer to do this on a mobile device. The iPod touch is perfect for this but if my phone can do it also, all the better.
  4. I should be able to listen to music and audio books on it.
  5. It must have a respectable battery life.
  6. Nice messaging features for instant messaging and email.
  7. Social networking capabilities.
  8. Ability to install other apps to meet my needs.

So, for my third reason for liking this phone, I am proud to say, that although it took quite some research, and even some hair pulling moments, I have been able to fulfill everything on this list, making this phone, as unassuming as it is, a perfect non-smart smart phone for me.

Most of the things on that list took little or no effort. The phone comes with an inbuilt App Store known as the Nokia Ovi Store. Here, I found apps for Bible, Dictionary, Instant Messenger (ebuddy), web browsing (UC Browser), Solitaire, etc.

I was also able to install the Facebook app and although I couldn&#8217;t find a twitter app, using twitter on the Opera Mini browser, which comes on it by default, more than makes up for that.

The phone also comes with a nice mail client which supports a host of email services, including Gmail, which I use. Setting it up was a breeze and soon, I was checking my email and sending new ones.

What most impressed me about this phone, and what inspired me to write this post, is the [Albite Reader app](http://albite.vlexofree.com/reader). I had been looking for an app with which to read epub (ebook file format) files and had all but given up before stumbling on that jewel of an app. It works surprisingly well, even better than I could have asked for, and has opened every epub file I have thrown at it. It makes my feature request complete.

An unexpected feature which this phone has is a home screen. Although its functionality is limited, it does provide some useful widgets and gives the phone a more modern feel to it.

Admittedly, this phone cannot be compared to any smartphone. For one, apart from SMS, there is no notification system for other services such as Facebook and twitter. There is no integration between applications and no multitasking. Advanced sharing features are also out of the question. High graphics intensive apps and games are also not possible.

Despite the obvious shortcomings however, lets face it; you don&#8217;t pick up a phone like this expecting any of these features to be present. What you do find however, is more than one would have thought possible with such a limited device and it turns out that, a smart phone might not be for everybody, and with a little tweaking, even a mid level feature phone can satisfy a budding technophile&#8217;s &#8220;thirst&#8221;; even if for a short while.
