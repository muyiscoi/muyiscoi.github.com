<p><em>This is the first episode in my NYSC Chronicles series which I <a href="http://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=411"  alt="">introduced</a> late last year. I'll try to post a new episode every other day but please bear with me if I miss a few.</em></p>
<p>The day was friday, March 2nd, 2012. As I walked into the crowded cafetaria hall, I could feel the tension in the air. It was evident on all the faces of the prospective corps members about to get their callup letters. If my own feelings was any indication, most of us were just about to burst with equal parts excitement and dread. The address written on that piece of paper would determine where we would spend the next year of our lives and we were all too aware of that.<br />
Nigeria, at the time, was a boiling pot of religious and political tension. The Northern part of the country in particular, was ridden with frequent and erratic bomb blasts, violent raids and wanton killing, aimed mostly at the christians and otherwise "foreigners" to the land. No 2011 fresh graduate of Covenant University looked forward to spending his/her service year in any of those 13 Nothern states and the most paranoid of us had taken measures to ensure that the decision wasn't left up to chance. Ofcourse, such things are never 100% sure, so, the tension was palpable on everyone, even those who claimed to have "worked" their posting.<br />
As we filed into the hall, we all took our seats on the chairs neatly arranged in rows and columns. At the front of the room stood tables placed in a straight line. Three men sat behind these tables and they wore a serious expression while poring over several files in front of them. After what seemed like an eternity, but was probably just a few minutes, the man in the middle stood up and began to address us. He told us to come forward when we hear our names and come along with our valid School ID cards as well as other relevant information.<br />
Shortly after the name calling began, so did the exclamations. Some people squealed in delight when they saw their letters and immediately proceeded to call someone to share the good news. Others wore an expression of pure disgust and looked like they might kill anyone who looked at them funny just then. A larger number of people were plainly relieved, and this was immediately evident from their facial expression and body language.<br />
I proceeded to stand up from my seat and ask a few people around me about their posting. Most of them got posted to states in the west, south and east, but a smattering of them were posted to the much dreaded northern states. A few even vowed that they wouldnt be going, but I chucked it up to initial "gra gra".<br />
I was busy conversing with Tosin, who got posted to Borno State, when I heard my name. I hurried down to the front of the hall and presented my ID card to the man in charge, He quickly looked over my credentials, asked me to sign on a form and presented me with my letter. I held my breath as I opened it just a crack to see what was written on it. That was the moment of truth. The time when I was to discover where I would have to spend the next one year. I snuck a peek but couldn't read it properly so I just summoned courage and opened the letter fully. I stared at it for a good few seconds before locating where the address of the camp was written. Right there, at the bottom, in bold was written "Yipata, Edu LGA, Kwara State".<br />
My heart skipped a beat, and then started beating really fast. Blood rushed to my ears and I couldn't hear anything going on around me. The tension left my body so quickly that I didn't even have time to register the fact that I hadn't realised I was so tense.<br />
I stared at the paper and reread it. Kwara State!.<br />
I Thanked God I wasn't going to any "Boko Haram Centre". I could live with kwara state. In fact, the more I though about it, the more I began to like the idea of Kwara State.<br />
I whipped out my phone to tell my folks at home the good news.</p>
