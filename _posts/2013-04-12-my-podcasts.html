<p>I am an avid listener/viewer of podcasts, and in this post, I will outline all the ones I am currently subscribed to.<br />
I have separated them into video and audio, based on the format I consume them in, not based on the available versions.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screenshot-from-2013-04-12-165716.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-497 aligncenter" src="https://www.muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screenshot-from-2013-04-12-165716.png" alt="Screenshot from 2013-04-12 16:57:16" width="397" height="98" /></a><em><em>Lightspeed</em> is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF&mdash;and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales. No subject is off-limits, and we encourage our writers to take chances with their fiction and push the envelope.<br />
The Podcast features audiobook-style recordings of four of the eight stories published each month in Lightspeed, released more or less on a weekly basis</em></p></p>
