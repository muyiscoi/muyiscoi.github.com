<p>As most of us know by now, today marks last day of Google Reader's existence. By the end of today, it will be shutdown and we would have lost one of the most important and pivotal parts of my internet experience. Google Reader has had a monumental influence on me, all the while ensuring it stayed out of my way while it did so.</p>
<p>I haven't yet decided on a replacement for Google Reader (Despite a plethora of new options springing up) but whatever I choose, I have a feeling it will not completely fill up the hole Google reader has left in its wake.</p>
<p>RIP Google Reader. So long and thanks for all the LOLs!</p>
