One of such projects is messing around with the Raspberry Pi.
  
I won an amazon gift card a few days back and used it to purchase a Raspberry Pi2 and some accessories.

With it, I installed Plex Media Server and configured all my media collection on it with a 1TB USB 3.0 hard drive I&#8217;ve had for quite a while. I can now stream my media collection from wherever I am on my phone, laptop or iPad.

I also intended on setting up the Pi as a file server for storage and backup, but it appears that might not be such a good idea. When playing media from the pi, there&#8217;s a lot of transcoding that goes on, and that could be quite CPU intensive. Adding yet another function for the device to do might be too much to handle.

Luckily, I still have one of my original Pi Model Bs lying dormant at the moment, and I intend on using that as the File/Backup server once I can get another external Hard Drive for it. In the mean time, I will set it up as a test server to implement cool linux server stuff and learn new things.

That&#8217;s what the summer is for after all isn&#8217;t it?
