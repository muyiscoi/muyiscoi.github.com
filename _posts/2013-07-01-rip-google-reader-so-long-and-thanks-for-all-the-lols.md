As most of us know by now, today marks last day of Google Reader&#8217;s existence. By the end of today, it will be shutdown and we would have lost one of the most important and pivotal parts of my internet experience. Google Reader has had a monumental influence on me, all the while ensuring it stayed out of my way while it did so.

I haven&#8217;t yet decided on a replacement for Google Reader (Despite a plethora of new options springing up) but whatever I choose, I have a feeling it will not completely fill up the hole Google reader has left in its wake.

RIP Google Reader. So long and thanks for all the LOLs!
