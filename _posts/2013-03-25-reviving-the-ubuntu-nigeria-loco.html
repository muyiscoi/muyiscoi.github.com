  content: I became an ubuntu user in 2011 when oneiric ocelot came out. Since then
    i have never looked back. Initially, i thought it will be a difficult operating
    system to use, but alas, it was so easy to use. I really like its user friendly
    environment with its loads of applications that are very easy to install. I am
    in support of this initiative if it can be sustained. I will be happy to assist
    anybody who will like to use ubuntu on their laptops or desktops. A community
    like the one you are planning will go along way in making lot of people feel at
    home with this awesome operating system.

  content: "Hi Tunde, Thanks for the comment. Things are moving rather slowly at the
    moment unfortunately. However, the place where Nigerian Ubuntu users are most
    active at the moment is on Nairaland. So, you can join in on the discussion there.

  content: I am trying to setup an Ubuntu server (CLI only) on a Netbook, and want
    to include routing capabilities. I am just stumbling along, since I am very new
    to Ubuntu. Can anyone help?

  content: "Hi there. It's cool that you're trying your hands on ubuntu server. I
    know it can be a bit daunting, especially for newbies. I found a nice tutorial
    for using ubuntu as a router here http://www.yourownlinux.com/2013/07/how-to-configure-ubuntu-as-router.html.
    However, it requires d desktop version, not server. They are pretty identical,
    d major difference being the default packages and the lack of a GUI on the server.
    U can also check out this link for routing using d server http://www.geekingatschool.com/2011/02/setup-ubuntu-server-as-a-simple-router/.
    It's pretty comprehensive but a little old, so might not still be entirely relevant.
    \nAn alternative could be to install \"pfsense\" which is a FreeBSD (another derivative
    of unix) based OS specifically for routing and firewall duties. \nAlso, if u want
    to use a computer as a router, it has to have at least two network interface cards,
    one for incoming connections and another for outgoing. Either both Ethernet, or
    Ethernet n wifi. \nAn alternative might be to get a wireless access point, and
    flash it with dd-wrt, which is a Linux based router OS, which would then give
    u access to advanced firewall and other such settings. \nHappy hacking :)"

It has a huge following world wide, Nigeria inclusive. Ubuntu Nigeria LoCo (Local Community) is a group made up of Ubuntu users in Nigeria, with the goals of "<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NigerianTeam">advocating, distributing, advertising, demonstrating and developing local attributes into Ubuntu within Nigeria</a>".<br />
Ubuntu Nigeria LoCo, best as I can figure, was founded in 2008. However, shortly after, it fizzled out and died.<br />
Sometime in 2010, I took a stab at reviving it, even getting a few things going for a few weeks or so, but I didn't really know what I was doing, and once school work caught up with me, I stopped working on it and it got its second burial.<br />
Like the saying goes, third time's the charm. I'm taking another stab at reviving this LoCo, and this time, I'm gonna do it right!.<br />
Wish me luck.</p>
