<p><a href="https://muyiscoi.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screenshot-from-2013-05-03-002730.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-511" alt="Parole media player" src="https://muyiscoi.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screenshot-from-2013-05-03-002730-580x383.png" width="580" height="383" /></a>I've been having issues with the default media player on Ubuntu (Totem) after upgrading to 13.04, and today, I finally decided to check out some of the alternatives available on the Ubuntu Software Centre. After a quick search, I came across<a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/parole/"> Parole Media Player</a>.</p>
<p><em>Parole is a modern simple media player based on the <a title="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" rel="nofollow">GStreamer</a> framework and written to fit well in the <a title="http://www.xfce.org" href="http://www.xfce.org" rel="nofollow">Xfce</a> desktop.</em><br />
<em> It is designed with simplicity, speed and resource usage in mind. </em></p>
<p>Even though it is written for the Xfce Desktop, Parole integrates perfectly into the Unity desktop, since they rely on a lot of the same dependencies. It has a simple interface and since it uses the GStreamer backend, supports virtually any audio or video format you can think of. Most importantly, I haven't experienced any of the annoyances of Totem while using it.</p>
<p>There are a few missing features such as the ability to a video resume from last played position, keyboard shortcuts for controlling audio volume within the app, etc. Development of the app is quite active, so I'm sure these features and more would be added soon. Overall, I am happy with this app and it has already replaced Totem on my Ubuntu 13.04 install.</p>
