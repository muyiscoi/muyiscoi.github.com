I&#8217;ve got a confession to make. I&#8217;m a geek!. Yeah, but you already knew that didn&#8217;t you?
  
I still need to prove my geekiness from time to time though, most recently and prominently, in the Etisalat Geek Force Internship Contest. I am still participating in the contest at the moment at an undisclosed location in the heart of Lagos Island ðŸ˜€ so I can&#8217;t really say much about it on this blog. However, I thought I should post something up on this blog about it, if only to act as a mile marker of my life which I can look back on later cos everyone knows no one reads this blog but me. See what I did there?

In a bid to prove to the folks at Eti-baba just how geeky I am, I made two videos which came out pretty nicely. I thought I should post them here so whichever poor sod is reading this post can see them for himself and bask in my geekiness :).

Here you go!
  




Hopefully, I will share some more info and maybe some good news on the competition in the future, but for now, pacify yourself with these fine videos ðŸ˜€
