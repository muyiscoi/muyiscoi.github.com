<p><em>NOTE:  I'm attempting to accomplish all the tasks laid out in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/2s924h/how_did_you_get_your_start/cnnw1ma">this</a> post. For more context, check out this <a href="https://muyiscoi.com/?p=915">blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>Before getting started, I need to prepare the hardware to be used. This includes storage, networking and compute resources. I only have access to my laptop for all these, so I'm a bit limited but should be able to make it work.</p>
<p>I have taken the following steps to setup the environment</p>
<ol>
<li>Installed CentOS7 x86_64 on a partition of the second hard drive in my laptop.</li>
<li>Ran an update</li>
<li>Installed KVM hypervisor on the CentOS host, and virt-manager to manage the VMs</li>
<li>Created a custom bridge for kvm (kvmbr0) and added the pNIC (enp1s0) as an interface in the bridge<a href="http://muyiscoi.github.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/network.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-920" src="http://muyiscoi.github.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/network-580x102.png" alt="custom bridge " width="580" height="102" /></a></li>
<li>Installed a CentOS7 guest on the KVM hypervisor configured to use the custom bridge configured above.</li>
<li>Installed <a href="http://spacewalkproject.org/download.html">Spacewalk</a> server on the first VM</li>
<li>Configured Dynamic DNS support on my home router using <a href="http://www.noip.com/">noip</a></li>
<li>Configured port forwarding for the ssh port on my router in order to have access to my host and VMs outside my local network</li><br />
</ol><br />
The VMs configured to use kvmbr0 bridge get assigned DHCP addresses by my router, and are therefore addressable anywhere within my private network. In the future, I will configure one of the VMs as a local DNS and DHCP server, and that will take care of IP address assignment and name resolution.</p>
