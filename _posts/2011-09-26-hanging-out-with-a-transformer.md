Over the past couple of days, I&#8217;ve had the opportunity of hanging out with a Transformer. No, unfortunately, not a real live Transformer like the ones found in the &#8220;[Transformers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers)&#8221; franchise. However, that doesn&#8217;t make it any less cool.

I am of course talking about the [Asus Eee Pad Transformer](http://www.asus.com/Eee/Eee_Pad/Eee_Pad_Transformer_TF101/).

Although my time with the device was very short, I feel I should still document my thoughts about it. This post is not going to be a review of the tablet as that has been done [over](http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/asus-eee-pad-transformer/4505-3126_7-34467853.html), [over](http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/asus-eee-pad-transformer-954145/review), and [over again](http://www.techspot.com/review/429-asus-eee-pad-transformer/) by people far more qualified than I am. Instead, I am just going to highlight my experience using it in the various use cases with which I might use a Tablet device, if I owned one.

I view a tablet as an internet and entertainment device first and foremost. Therefore, I must be able to browse, watch movies/play music with it and enjoy myself while doing so. The Transformer is quite bulky and so, cannot be held with one hand. It however has a nice pouch (which has to be purchased separately) which can double as a stand for the device. Also, and this is probably what makes this device very attractive, it has an optional keyboard dock which would effectively turn the device into an Android powered netbook.

**Web Browsing**

Web browsing experience on this device has already been tainted for me by the fact that it is WiFi only. This therefore limits its ability to connect to the internet to the availability of an active and accessible WiFi connection within range. This therefore requires the purchase of a portable WiFi device or using your phone to share you data connection while on the move. This might not be a really big issue in countries where you find free WiFi in several public places but right here, it is. Fortunately for me, we have a WiFi connection at home, and so, I was able to browse with the device while at home.

Now, unto the browsing experience itself. The Transformer runs Android Honeycomb 3.1 Operating System from Google. The OS comes with a browser which is adequate for regular browsing needs. I was able to use this to open several pages and utilized its tabbed browsing UI effectively. The scrolling was quite smooth on most sites and I was even able to play Youtube videos right on the page without noticing any significant performance issues. I could also download files and view them right from the inbuilt File Browser.  For a better browsing experience though, I downloaded &#8220;Dolphin Browser for pad&#8221; which enables more robust features such as browser plugins support. Other browsers such as Opera Mini/Mobile and Mozilla Firefox are also available for download. Overall, my browsing experience was what I expected from such a device and the availability of Flash support made me feel like I was actually using something that could replace my Laptop for some use cases.

Score: 7.5/10

**Playing Multimedia Files**

Multimedia playback is another important criteria for me when considering the usability of a Tablet. For the most part, the Asus Transformer performed excellently in this department. I loved the fact that, without having to install any driver or syncing software on my Windows 7 Laptop, I was able to access the storage of the device and copy music and video files directly into it. The music files were all recognized in the formats I tried (mp3, wma, m4a). The unavailability of an application to play videos was a bit off-putting though. This was however easily fixed with one search in the Android Market (application store for Android) where I found and installed the excellent &#8220;Mobo Media Player&#8221;. Playing Videos was mostly smooth but I experienced a little bit of choppiness when playing a 720p video file. This is barely noticeable though and doesn&#8217;t detract you from enjoying the movie.

Score: 8.75/10

**Document and E-book Support**

This device is being marketted as a Tablet for business and entertainment. It is therefore required to come with tools that enable you to do just that. On the Business side of things, It comes with &#8220;Polaris® Office&#8221; which provides support for &#8220;Microsoft® Office&#8221; document formats. Documents can also be edited and created using this application. I don&#8217;t see myself using this app much though, except to view documents. It will especially be useful for people who purchased the Transformer with the keyboard dock; however, the rig I tested didn&#8217;t come with that and typing long documents with a virtual keyboard is not much fun.

As for ebooks, the tablet comes with an application known as &#8220;MyLibrary&#8221; which enables you to view &#8220;.pdf&#8221; and &#8220;.epub&#8221; files (those were the two formats I tried). It presents the &#8220;.epub&#8221; files in a book like interface, complete with a page flipping animation when changing pages. This worked just like I expected it to and I was quite pleased with the result.

Score: 8.5/10

**3rd Party Application/Games Support**

Since this tablet runs on Android OS, it inherits the whole Android application catalogue. The presentation of these apps though vary greatly. Some applications I installed, such as &#8220;Google Reader&#8221;,&#8221; CNN&#8221; and &#8220;Bible (You Version)&#8221; worked perfectly and had nicely optimized interfaces for tablets while others such as &#8220;NYTimes&#8221;, &#8220;Nigerian News&#8221;, etc. had interfaces that were clearly designed for a smaller screen, and when scaled to cover the larger screen looked too big and having too much white space; and others still, such as &#8220;Merriam Websters Dictionary&#8221; application refused to scale to fill up the screen and just occupied to upper middle corner of the screen.

Performance wise, all the apps, irrespective of how they looked performed excellently and even with more than 10 applications running, there is no noticeable lag in performance of the device.

As for games, Android also enjoys a wide assortment of games, from the simple ones such as &#8220;Solitaire&#8221; and &#8220;Sudoku&#8221;, to the ones which have become worldwide phenomenon on mobile devices such as &#8220;Angry Birds&#8221;, &#8220;Cut the rope&#8221; and &#8220;Fruit Ninja&#8221;, down to the 3D and resource intensive games such as the Racing games and the Football games. I installed a few of these games to check out how they performed on the device and they all worked perfectly.

Score: 6.7/10

**Overall Performance**

Overall, I was quite impressed with this device. During the time that I used it, my laptop got a much deserved rest and this on its own is a testament to how useful it is. The fact that it can stand on its own without needing to dock into the &#8220;mother ship&#8221; like the iPad makes it even more desirable. The interface is intuitive and easy to get used to, the applications work perfectly and the device can be used effectively with just the default applications it comes with. There are some glitches here and there, such as an error dialog that kept popping up at odd intervals, but overall, this is a solid device which one would be happy to own and use. I know I was, even if for a short period of time.

Overall Score: 7.9/10
