To say that I love Sherlock Holmes stories would be a great understatement. I have read everything from &#8220;A study in Scarlet&#8221; to &#8220;A Scandal in Bohemia&#8221; to &#8220;His last Bow&#8221; and almost every story in between.

I have always been weary of derivative works, especially in the visual format as they always fall short of the original. However, for a literary derivative, I do not have much experience.

I therefore had a feeling of both excitement and caution when I learned about &#8220;The Pirate King&#8221; by Laurie R. King which is based on the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and a new protagonist in Mary Russel.
  
I&#8217;m not one to jump into a new book series in its 9th book though so I had to go get the book 1 and start from the beginning.

The Beekeeper&#8217;s Apprentice is set in the early 1900s and stars a semi-retired Sherlock Holmes at his Retirement home cum Bee farm in Sussex, England. He seems to have resigned himself to a life of a Bee farmer, away from the hustle and bustle of his former life. By chance, he comes across a teenager, Mary Russel who just recently moved into a house/farm not far from Holmes. It turns out she possesses an intellect to match that of Holmes and thus began the unlikely apprenticeship turn partnership.

<!--more-->The book focuses mainly, at least at the beginning, with the training Mary Russel receives from Holmes and gradually shows an increase in mutual respect and even affection between the two. In the later part, they work on cases together, first as master and apprentice, and later as partners, and eventually face off against a very formidable adversary, almost paying with their lives.

The Beekeeper&#8217;s Apprentice takes some liberties with the story of Sherlock Holmes. For one, Holmes is much younger than he would have been had he the time line been followed exactly. This is attributed to the fact that his age was exaggerated in the original stories to give a sense of wisdom to his character.
  
Also, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of the original sherlock Holmes stories, was portrayed as a part of &#8220;The Strand&#8221; (the magazine that published the original stories) and was involved in the publication of Dr. Watson&#8217;s stories. Apart from those, and a few other changes of lesser importance or relevance, the stories stayed pretty consistent with the original Holmes stories.
  
Since the book was set in a relatively more modern time than the original ones, modern inventions such as the Telephone, Electricity and Automobiles had to be incorporated into the stories and these were done beautifully. In the original stories, some modern inventions, most notably the Gramophone, made appearances but they are ever more present here.

Overall, I believe Laurie King did an excellent job of portraying Holmes by being true to the original stories but also not being afraid to tweak it where necessary. It made for a story both familiar and new; enjoyable by die hard Sherlock Holmes fans and new readers alike.

I would be picking up the Book 2 at my earliest convenience and will continue on with the rest as time allows.
