I was an early adopter of Hi5 and the like back in the day, and signed up for a Facebook account pretty early on. I also have accounts on most of the usual suspects like Instagram, Twitter, etc.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-723"></a>I made an early decision to only add people I know on Facebook. I am not a celebrity, or famous by any definition of the word, so I don't expect strangers to have any interest in anything I have to say.</p>
<p>This rule didn't extend to pages though, so over the years, I followed lots of pages on Facebook around my interests and likes, and that slowly transformed my account from a tool to connect to people I actually know, to a never ending feed of information and distraction.</p>
<p>I rarely got to see the updates from people I actually knew, instead, my stream was filled with posts from news sites, blogs, funny videos, game invites and the like. This provided me with a ready source of distraction whenever I didn't have anything specific to do, and was a quick way to kill time, killing my productivity in the process.</p>
<p>Over on Twitter, I didn't have any rule of thumb as regards following people, so I more or less followed whoever I thought to be interesting, as well as people I knew, and brands/websites I liked. With following just over 300 accounts, I had such an active twitter stream that it was virtually impossible to keep up. Five seconds after refreshing the page, I would have upwards of 25 to 50 new tweets waiting to be read, with double that amount generated once I was done. This got pretty unmanageable, and degraded the overall social experience for me so much that I actually abandoned twitter for a while.</p>
<p>Over on Instagram, things were a bit more tame. Since it is my newest social network, the cruft hadn't quite developed to the stages of the two aforementioned sites, but the signs were definitely there.</p>
<p>Here, I was following a handful of our local artistes and celebrities, and on any given day, they could post 10 pictures and videos in quick succession, flooding my stream. This would probably make me miss out on a post from someone I actually know IRL that I might have been interested in.</p>
<p>It got to a point where it all got to be a bit too much for me. Social media is supposed to be a way to keep up with friends and connect with them; find people with shared interests and make intelligent conversations around said interests. With the invasion of the brands and celebrities on the social feeds, this experience was diluted, nay extinguished for me, and I knew I had to do something about it.</p>
<p>Right now, I have a much more sane social media presence. I have Unliked/Unfollowed all pages on Facebook, as well as unfollowed all brand and celebrity accounts on Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p>The one standout for me is Google+ because, I mostly used it as a socially aggregated news feed around my interests.</p>
<p>I have found that this has improved my engagement drastically. I now actually get to see posts and tweets from people I know/whose opinion I care about. More importantly, I now have time to reflect on their posts and reply appropriately without getting distracted by a thousand more posts waiting to be read.</p>
<p>I know the temptation remains to keep adding on the pages and accounts, but I know it's a slippery slope that would take me back to where I started, so I'm resolute to keeping my social accounts as lean as possible, thereby getting the most out of the social experience for which I signed up to those services in the first place.</p>
