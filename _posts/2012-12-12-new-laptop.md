Today, I took delivery of my spanking new laptop (pictured above). Its a <a href="http://m.bestbuy.com/m/b/product/detail.jsp?skuId=6747396&#038;pid=1218792108689"  alt="">Lenovo Ideapad P500</a>. It comes with Windows 8 preinstalled and you can be sure I wasted no time in loading <a href="http://ubuntu.com"  alt="">Ubuntu</a> on it also. The process of dualbooting with newer laptops is infinitely more painful and I almost gave up.
  
I welcome the newest addition to my collection of electronics and it is a nice addition indeed.
