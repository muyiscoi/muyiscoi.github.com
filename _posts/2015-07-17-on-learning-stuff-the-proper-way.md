Ever since my brother put me on to Ubuntu way back in 2007 I&#8217;ve been hooked on it, and have used it and its different incarnations (Distros) in one capacity or the other constantly since then.

<!--more-->What I have neglected to do though, is go through any kind of formal training or course on Linux. I learnt stuff here and there, initially from my brother, and later on by trying to figure stuff out on my own.

There is no shortage of blog posts and videos to help you figure out just about anything you want to do on linux, and after a while, I began to get pretty good at doing stuff, even advanced stuff.

What I&#8217;ve realized though, is that use cases vary and for something as ubiquitous as Linux, there are a thousand and one use cases. Without going through any formal training, either self taught or classroom based, I was only learning stuff I needed to perform tasks related to my narrow use case (which mostly revolved around normal desktop use). I&#8217;ve picked up some skills not strictly relevant to my use case over the years, however, for the most part I&#8217;ve been narrowly focused.

In order to make a career out of being the Linux guy, a moniker for which I am already known amongst my friends, I have to go out of my comfort zone and actually learn, in a semi formal way, the in and outs of the Linux operating system, imbibing as much as I can to be knowledgeable in any use case, especially server based ones.

Some pet projects I have done in the past, such as the countless distro installations as well as several Raspberry pi based media streaming contraptions, have prepared me for some of what I need to know, so its more of connecting the dots and filling  in the knowledge gap where necessary in order to possess a more unified knowledge of the OS, and be able to confidently imbibe the &#8220;Linux guy&#8221; monicker.

I&#8217;m on my way!.
