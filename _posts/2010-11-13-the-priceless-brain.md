I got this piece from a seminar I attended earlier today and decided to share it with y&#8217;all. Enjoy

A man had a brain &#8220;disease&#8221; and he went to his neurosurgeon. After examining him, the surgeon declares that he needs brain transplant surgery. The Surgeon then shows him 4 identical cases and tells him to choose one of them to be his new brain.
  
The man then asked the surgeon about the prices of the brains.

The Surgeon showed him the first case and told him that it was worth $100000. It was an &#8220;American Brain&#8221;. The man complained that it was too expensive and asked for something cheaper. Then, the surgeon showed him the second case which happened to be a &#8220;German Brain&#8221;. This one, the surgeon said, was valued at $95000 but it can be sold for $80000. Again, the man complained about the cost. He then asked about the other two cases he saw on the table. An identical scene ensued where the surgeon told him that they were &#8220;Chinese&#8221; and &#8220;British&#8221; brains which were both valued at $85000. At this point, the man was running out of options because he could not afford any of the brains showed to him.
  
As he was contemplating his next course of action, he spotted another identical case at the far corner of the room and asked the surgeon about it. The surgeon replied that, if he couldn&#8217;t afford these ones showed to him, then he most definitely couldn&#8217;t afford that one. The patient was still persuasive so the doctor brought out the last brain and told him that it is an &#8220;African&#8221; brain and it is priceless.
  
And, it is priceless because, it has **never been used**.

The Americans build bridges
  
The Gernams built Cars
  
The British Colonized
  
The Chinese Revolutionized
  
Africans &#8230;
