    My laptop without its clothes on ðŸ˜€

I did this a while ago, and can&#8217;t believe I haven&#8217;t posted about itÂ sooner.

I&#8217;ve had [my current laptop](https://muyiscoi.com/?p=386) for almost 4Â years now and while its still going strong, are getting a bit outdated. Since I can&#8217;t afford to buy a new laptop at the moment, I decided to upgrade my current machine as much as I possibly can.

The first thing to do was to replace the 1TB Hdd with a 250Gb Samsung EVO850 SSD. Just doing this caused a very noticeable improvement to the speed of the machine. A couple of months later, I upgraded the RAM to 16GB (which is the maximum supported by the laptop) and took out the DVD drive, installing the 1TB HDD in its place.

I also replaced the power adapter and battery, but had to return the battery I got &#8216;cos it was performing worse that the one originally on the laptop.

At the moment, I&#8217;m pretty happy with the machine. I would still love to get a newer machine in the future, but for now, my Laptop has a new (ish) lease on life.
