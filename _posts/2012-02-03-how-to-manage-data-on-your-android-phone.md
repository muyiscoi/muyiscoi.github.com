It is not news anymore that Android can be a data guzzling beast. However, in these times when people are ever more conscious of thier spending habits it is important to know just how this data is spent and what can be done to curtail it.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What exactly is eating my data?</span>**

Several factors contribute to give andriod its reputation as a data guzzler. Some of them are listed below:

**Apps sync**
  
After setting up your google account as well as other accounts such as facebook, twitter and yahoo on thier respective apps, these applications constantly synchronise themselves in order to get whatever new data that is available for them. These actions on thier own might not amount to much data but over a period of time, with several apps at once, it becomes significant. Some other apps that are not social or IM are also culprits of this. Most notable of which are news reader apps such as the &#8220;Pulse&#8221; news app.

**Contacts Sync**
  
The android phonebook can synchronize contacts from whatever online accounts that are linked to it. This can include Google, Yahoo, Facebook and even twitter. These synchronizations also take chunks out of your data plan

**Browsers**
  
More and more web companies are building mobile versions of their website, however a lot of sites we visit regularly still do not have mobile versions and as such, when visiting them on a phone, the full site is loaded; thereby eating away at your precious mobile data.

These are the three common means by which data is depleted on android and indeed most other smart phone platforms.
  
Now that we know what is causing the problem, we need to learn how to manage it.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data management techniques</span>**
  
Several data management techniques need to be used together in order to achieve noticeable results. They are as follows:

**Use Applications to access services**
  
Although it might seem like I am contradicting myself here, I assure you I am not. Most sites we visit on a regular basis on our phones now have mobile applications for accessing their services. Although these apps might take quite a bit of data to download, they save you data in the long run. This is because, such applications only need to load the data it wants to display to you in order to function properly as the [user interface chrome](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_chrome) is already there. However, loading that service from a browser would require downloading the data, as well as the UI chrome everytime.

**Use Opera Mini web browser**
  
This is simple enough. Opera mini has a very good reputation among mobile data users. It can generate a mobile site for websites that do not have native mobile versions. It also uses Opera servers to provide website compression of up to 90%. It is therefore ideal for the data conscious mobile user, save the more paranoid amongst us who don&#8217;t want our data traffic passing through a third party server. Opera mini is a free download on the Android market.

**Disable Application Syncronisation**
  
If you don&#8217;t really need to recieve your emails as and when they appear in your inbox, immediate facebook message notification. Twitter mention/DM notification, etc., one of the ways to save data is to disable App Sync on your android phone. This ensures that you only get your notifications whenever you perform a manual sync. Most apps are affected by this while others such as yahoo messenger still give you notifications once you get an IM even when app sync is disabled.

**Switch off data services at night**
  
I don&#8217;t know about you but I have no use for data while I am asleep. Whatever email,  facebook message, IM, mention or DM I might get at 3am in the morning would remain unread until I wake up so I see no reason why it should land on my phone immediately it is sent. Therefore, I always switch off the data on my phone before going to bed. It would also work wonders for your phone&#8217;s battery life.
  
Data services can be switched off from android settings.

**Exit apps not in use**
  
Tapping the back button on android exits most applications. However, pressing the home button only minimises the app and lets it continue running in the background. It is therefore important to remember to properly exit apps when they are no longer in use. This is especially important for apps that use data but is also good practise for all apps as it helps save battery life.

**Use third party apps and widgets to monitor and manage data usage**

Several third party apps and widgets are available for free on the Android market that provide the ability to monitor you data usage by showing you how much data you have used in your plan as well as showing you the data each application has used.

The applications I use for this are

1. My data manager free (app and widget)
  
2. Data enabler widget (for enabling and disabling data without having to go into  settings)
  
3. Power monitor widget (comes with default install).

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>**
  
I hope this post would be able to help most groaning android phone owners realise that they can manage thier data better and get more bang for their buck.
  
Even if you don&#8217;t use android,some of the information here might still be useful to you.
  
This is by no means an exhaustive list of things you can do to reduce data consumption. If you know of anything I might have omitted, please don&#8217;t hesitate to let us know in the comments.
