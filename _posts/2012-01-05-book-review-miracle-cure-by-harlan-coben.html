Miracle Cure is a book revolving around a Couple. The Man, Micheal Silverman, is a renown basketball player with the NY Nicks and his wife, Sara Lowell, is a popular TV Network news reporter. Their family, friends and acquaintances all seem to be connected to a conspiracy involving serial murders, lies, suicides and other such gruesome acts all apparently related to a top secret AIDS clinic.</p>
<p>Miracle Cure is an old book having first been published in 1991. It was brought back into print last year. As a result, a lot of the issues addressed in the book have a dated outlook to them.<br />
For one, the AIDS pandemic was much less widespread at the time and was mostly limited to Gay men and intravenous drug addicts. As a result, attention of the medical community to the disease was minimal.</p>
<p>A lot of societal issues were raised in such a masterful manner in this book that it did not hinder the story telling. You therefore get an excellent story, as well as education, albeit dated, into the goings on of the medical world in terms of AIDS and other pertinent issues.</p>
<p>What I liked the most about this book is the suspense. It is so thick that it can be cut with a knife. The suspense is also consistent throughout the book. As a matter of fact, you do not fully grasp what is going on until the final pages of the book. You might be able to accurately guess at some what is going on, but with the way the story is told, I believe it is almost impossible to figure it all out and when it is finally revealed, you'll just go aaah! as you realize how much sense it all makes.</p>
<p>Miracle Cure is one of those books that you might not want to put down once you pick it up. Thankfully, its relatively small and would amount to a quick read, and so not eat up all your hours of productivity.</p>
<p>I wholly recommend this book and if you can look past its outdated nature and some of the touchy issues it addresses, you are in for a very enjoyable read!.</p>
