<p>Over the past couple of years, I've made efforts to becoming an Infrastructure engineer&#47;system administrator, with varying levels of intensity. Over the past year or so, those efforts have been intensified with my Masters program and certification courses. In the next series of posts, I would be trying something a bit different.</p>
<p>While procrastinating on reddit a while back, I came across a post from someone asking about how to get started as a sysadmin. One of the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.reddit.com&#47;r&#47;linuxadmin&#47;comments&#47;2s924h&#47;how_did_you_get_your_start&#47;cnnw1ma">comments<&#47;a>&nbsp;on that post resonated with me, and challenged me to do more about achieving my goals. The comment, linked above, provided some tasks which a Linux sysadmin should be able to perform, and I will be attempting to accomplish them all over the next couple of days (or weeks depending on how complex they are). I will be documenting my progress on this blog. Might not go into too much technical details on some points, but will try to link to any online resource I use as much as possible.</p>
<p>This should be exciting.</p>
