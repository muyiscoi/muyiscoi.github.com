The Bus Stop at location 3 has been undergoing some changes lately and nobody seems to know what the hell they are doing. The government a constructed bus stop, and a few months later, demolished it. They then created a car park out of former greenery no less, and tried to force all the taxi drivers to load and offload passengers there. The only thing they didn&#8217;t take into account of course were the passengers. Passengers weren&#8217;t involved or informed while all the arrangements and rearrangements were being made and so, they refused to use the new parks. Drivers go where there passengers are and so, the drivers stopped using the new park and started using ingenious tactics to “load” passengers out of the old location. Needless to say, the whole place is a mess now and one has no idea where he is supposed to go to get a taxi and we just kinda “go with the flow ™”

So, here I was at location 3 trying to figure out where I was supposed to go to get a taxi to location 2 when a Peugeot 504 screeches to a stop right in front of me. The driver sticks his neck out of the window and shouts “Portharcourt boy don come oh!. Original Portharcourt Boy don come oh!”. Then he alights from the vehicle and started signing the popular song, “Portharcout boy” by Duncan Mighty, albeit an abridged and heavily distorted version. After a few seconds of this, he (who shall henceforth be referred to as “Portharcourt boy”) apparently gets bored and switches to shouting at drivers passing on the road. He singled out a taxi driver that was about to park on the other side of the road to call for his passengers. “No park for there” he shouted. “I say no park for there you no dey hear me?”. The driver at first seemed like he would comply, and then must have decided against it because he parked his car properly and started calling for passengers in earnest. This must have ticked off Portharcourt boy because he immediately picked up a stone from the floor and started moving towards the taxi, muttering things like “you go see wetin I go do you now”. A few feet away, he suddenly dropped the stone and moved back to his original position, explaining to passersby who absolutely did not care that “na my boy. I don see im face. If no be my boy, you for see wetin I for do am for here”. At that point, I&#8217;d had enough and decided to change position in order to find a taxi.

After walking further into the street a bit, I saw a taxi going to location 2 and jumped into it. I was the first passenger to enter the taxi and not long after I had entered, I began to notice a few peculiarities. First of all, the driver was a woman. Now, that in itself was not an oddity. There are several female taxi drivers around but most of them drive government issued vehicles which are generally better looking than the rust bucket that most other taxi are. This particular taxi though, was just as bad (or even worse) as the ones the men drive. Secondly, I noticed a sizeable “spongebob” stuffed doll hanging from the driver&#8217;s mirror. This drew my attention mostly because it was such a contrast with the rest of the taxi and it was kinda funny. The third thing was the voice of the driver yelling “location 2 na 100 naira oh! Make sure say you hold your 100 naira”. Normally, this route costs ₦50. However, I wasn&#8217;t gonna argue &#8216;cos I was already tired of waiting and just wanted to get home.

Since location 0 is beyond location 2 but on the same route, my driver loaded the rest of the taxi with location 0 passengers and we began to move.

Then came the announcement. “If you know say you dey go location 0 na 150 naira you go pay oh!. Location 2 na 100 naira. Ask this fine bros wey sidon for here. I tell am when im enter say na 100 naira I go collect. So if you dey go location 0 na 150 I go collect.”

Then came the mandatory hollering. “Why you no tell us before now? You for tell us before we enta your moto. If to say we know we for no enter you moto now” … and so on. This continued for quite a bit until only one passenger was left shouting. That, naturally, was the man right beside me. The man kept on assuring the driver that he was not going to pay ₦150 and the driver kept on assuring him that he would. “Make we reach there now we go see weda you no go pay. You think say na today I don dey drive taxi? I don dey for this business for 16 years. I get 6 other beta ones for road. This na the one wey I take start na im make I still dey drive am. I no won change am” . The man then went on the offensive “You know who I be? You know who you carry for moto wey you dey shout dey tell me to pay 150?”.

This must have really gotten the woman angry cos she replied “Oga you dey talk like woman!. How you go dey inside my moto dey talk like woman? I no won know who you be. Even if you be man wey dey wear uniform, or you be IG, you go still pay me my 150. In fact, e good as you be man wey dey wear uniform. Go call anybody wey you wan call. I go pour my poverty on top im head. You tink say na person wey things beta for na im dey drive taxi? If to say things beta you tink say I go dey drive taxi? Go call anybody wey you wan call. I go pour my poverty on top im head”.

The exchange went on like this for a bit, and although I was totally enjoying myself, it eventually died down.

Then came the inevitable “hold up”. The temperature in the car got even higher than it already was as a result of the lack of motion and the two men beside me asked the driver for the “winer” (not to be mistaken with the &#8220;wiper&#8221;). She replied by saying “Abeg that thing no dey wine oh. Una go manage am like that”. Needless to say, that didn&#8217;t go down well with the men and they started off again. This exchange went on until I got to location 2 and alighted. I was almost tempted to continue down to location 0 just to witness the final outcome and who will eventually fold. Oh well, I&#8217;d had enough excitement for one day.

Thankfully, the last lap in the journey was uneventful until I got back home.
