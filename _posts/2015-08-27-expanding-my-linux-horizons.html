<p>I've been a Linux user for almost a decade now, and through all that time, I mostly used Ubuntu Linux. I was hooked on Ubuntu after being introduced to it by my brother back in 2007. A trackpad driver issue meant that I had to use an external mouse on my laptop, however, by Googling around and following some simple instructions, I was able to fix the issue and get the trackpad working. That act of fixing something so fundamental myself on an OS I use was so empowering that I've been hooked ever since.</p>
<p>I was a freshman in University at the time, and when I got back to school, I introduced Ubuntu (then 7.04) to 3 of my close friends at the time, and they all seemed intrigued. We continued to explore this world of Linux and, maybe in part to differentiate themselves from me, my friends eventually settled on different distributions of Linux as their preferred distro. One chose PCLinuxOS, while another chose LinuxMint and the third chose Mandriva. I stuck with Ubuntu and things progressed from there.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-806"></a>Over the years, I haven't really felt the need to deviate from my choice as I have been pretty content with the default Ubuntu install, even through all the changes in default applications, Gnome 2 to the different incarnations of Unity.</p>
<p>In the last year or so, I have been getting serious about learning more about the underlying technology of Linux, and becoming proficient at deploying and administering Linux servers, as well as Networking, supporting, scaling, etc. As a result, I am now enrolled in a Masters Degree program in Computer Network Administration and Management. I therefore felt that it was important for me to not only expand my knowledge on the server end, but also see what was out there for desktop Linux apart from Ubuntu.</p>
<p>To be clear, I have been trying out alternative distros for a long time, dating back to my early days of Linux. I have installed countless distros, both in VMs and directly on my hardware, however, in all instances, I fully had the intention of going back to good old Ubuntu once the experiment was completed. Distros such as Linux Mint and Elementary OS have even almost convinced me to jump ship completely, but I always end up going back.</p>
<p>From above, you can see that I tended to favour Debian/Ubuntu based distros, even when trying out alternatives, mainly 'cos I had become intimately familiar with the debian way of doing things from installing apps, upgrading, adding PPAs (for the Ubuntu based distros), etc. so I was still in a familiar environment even when not on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I took the plunge and wiped off Ubuntu from my laptop. I decided to try out the other major distros out there seriously, and if I found one that I truly liked, I would stick with it.<br />
The first distro I tried was Arch Linux. Installing Arch is truly unconventional, as there is no graphical, or even text based installer. There is a base system that you load up to a bootable media (USB stick, DVD, etc) and boot into a terminal. Then you setup drive partitioning, filesystem, networking, etc. all using Linux command line tools. A command is executed which then pulls down a base install of Linux with the kernel and all the necessary applications to the harddrive. You then chroot into that base install, run commands to install all the other stuff you need (such as a Window manager, display server, desktop environment, etc.) and then, when you're done, restart the computer and cross your fingers hoping you did everything right, after which you should be greeted with your freshly installed and highly bleeding edge version of Linux.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, it took me a while to get it installed. I didn't want to be stranded without a bootable computer, so I practised with VMs first, and after 3 tried was finally confident that I had every step down, so I went ahead with the install on the actual hardware.</p>
<p>My Arch Install had vanilla Gnome 3.14, devoid of any distro configurations or integrations, since it came directly from upstream (as all Arch software does). I had a few minor issues with it at first, but was able to resolve them and actually ended up liking it quite a bit. The package management on Arch, the Arch user repository (aur) and the fact that its a "rolling" OS, meant that I had access to pretty much any software I wanted, and got updates for everything almost immediately after they are released.</p>
<p>You are your own worst enemy with a distro like Arch though, and I ended up messing things up for myself.<br />
A few weeks after I installed Arch, Gnome 3.16 was released, and it was in the testing repo for Arch. I couldn't wait though, so I enabled the testing repo and upgraded my laptop to Gnome 3.16. Suffice it to say, not everything worked properly and I ended up having to hose the Arch install.</p>
<p>I reinstalled Ubuntu for a while, cos I had exams to prepare for, and didn't wanna monkey around with an unfamiliar OS during that time.</p>
<p>After exams, I again resumed my experiments, and this time around, chose Fedora. Instead of just plain Fedora Workstation, I decided to go with the KDE respin. I had some experience with KDE in the past, with distros like PCLinuxOS, Mandriva and Kubuntu. I hadn't used it as my main Desktop Environment (DE) though, so I was a little nervous. However, since I was in the mood of trying stuff out, I gave it a go.</p>
<p>The installation process was smooth enough, and I soon had a fresh install of Fedora 22 KDE Respin. I spent a while familiarising myself with the KDE interface, and I was soon proficient enough to get stuff done on it. I was able to install some apps, making sure to search for a KDE alternative in each case.</p>
<p>After just two days though, I was fed up!. KDE has desktop applets called "plasmoids" which do everything from display icons on your desktop to display system stats such as networking, disk usage, etc., displaying a fancy analogue clock on the desktop and lots more. The problem is, those things are resource guzzling monsters. My laptops fans began blowing loudly once I had more than one or two of them activated at a time, and this made them completely useless for any real world use.<br />
I could do without the plasmoids, as Ubuntu didn't have them and that was just fine with me. I could even do with the fact that I could not get my sftp file server to connect reliably on the default file manager that came with the distro. What I couldn't do without though, was the lack of "Start button" functionality.</p>
<p>The Start button might be a relic from the days of Windows, but that "super" key (or whatever you want to call it) on the desktop has more or less the same function on virtually every OS in existence. It is used to call up some sort of menu or search button where one can launch applications or view currently running ones.<br />
Unfortunately, the folks at KDE felt they didn't need to implement this functionality by default. That would have been fine with me, provided they provided the ability to map the key bindings manually, however, after googling around, I found out that this was completely impossible to do on KDE. That was the straw that broke the camel's back, as that button is an integral part of my workflow.<br />
At that point, I didn't want to perform a fresh install, so I decided to install the Fedora Workstation meta package, thereby installing all the packages to enable the Fedora 22 Workstation with Gnome on the same base install. This process went smoothly, and I was soon able to switch user into a Gnome 3.16 Desktop. Mixing two desktop environments on one base install is not always a good idea though, so I eventually had to wipe the laptop once again, and install the official Fedora 22 Workstation on it.</p>
<p>Weeks later, I still have Fedora Workstation installed. I seemed to have found the sweet-spot between bleeding edge and stability. I have access to a fairly wide application base, with several popular third party repos available. The apps get updated fairly quickly, and I have a reasonable confidence that my laptop would boot up after a kernel upgrade or even a simple shutdown and reboot.<br />
The Gnome Desktop has definitely improved tremendously, and is now more than capable. I might still prefer some design choices in Ubuntu Unity, but I am definitely not missing them enough to switch back. Also, several excellent extensions are available to tweak the Gnome interface and make it just right for me.<br />
The rpm base, and tools such as dnf (formerly yum) have made me expand my linux skills on the desktop, even as I continue to improve my core Linux knowledge.</p>
<p>My horizons have definitely been expanded, and I've learnt a lot along the way. I might decided to continue on this journey in a while, and there might be better options for me out there, but for now, I'm just fine with Fedora and would be sticking with it for a while still.</p>
