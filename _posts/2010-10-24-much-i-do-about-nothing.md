I resumed for my last session of Uni Â over a month ago. Its a little unnerving to look back now and see how much time has passed. Its been over four years but it sure doesn&#8217;t feel that way.
  
This session however, i have several things on my mind. For one, i have to prepare for my final project. I also have to make sure my grades are stellar so i don&#8217;t drop or anything like that. All in all, i am in for one hell of an hectic session.

Imagine my surprise therefore when i realized just today, that over one month is already Â gone. This time thing has started playing tricks on me again. What happened to lofty ideas about making effective use of every second? where has the month gone? I can barely speak of achievements over the past month. Most noticeably, i still havn&#8217;t made much head way with the project.

On realization however, I am poised to do something about my plight. I shall begin implementing those ideas and make dis year the best yet. Wish me luck ðŸ™‚

PS: Ubuntu 10.10 is now happily residing on my laptop and its excellent. It solves the only issue I&#8217;ve had for a while now; which is the suspend mode.
