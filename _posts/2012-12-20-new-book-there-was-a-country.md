**Official Blurb:** _From the lege<img class="size-full wp-image-400 alignleft" src="https://www.muyiscoi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/there-was-a-country-by-achebe.jpg" alt="there-was-a-country-by-achebe" width="257" height="398" />ndary author of_ Things Fall Apart _comes a long awaited memoir about coming of age with a fragile new nation, then watching it torn asunder in a tragic civil war_

_The defining experience of Chinua Achebeâ€™s life was the Nigerian civil war, also known as the Biafran War, of 1967â€“1970. The conflict was infamous for its savage impact on the Biafran people, Chinua Achebeâ€™s people, many of whom were starved to death after the Nigerian government blockaded their borders. By then, Chinua Achebe was already a world-renowned novelist, with a young family to protect. He took the Biafran side in the conflict and served his government as a roving cultural ambassador, from which vantage he absorbed the warâ€™s full horror. Immediately after, Achebe took refuge in an academic post in the United States, and for more than forty years he has maintained a considered silence on the events of those terrible years, addressing them only obliquely through his poetry. Now, decades in the making, comes a towering reckoning with one of modern Africaâ€™s most fateful events, from a writer whose words and courage have left an enduring stamp on world literature._

There hasn&#8217;t been a book that I have wanted to buy more than this one of in recent history. I know what I&#8217;ll be getting might not be the most unbiased account of what happened back then, but at least, its something.
  
Nigerians shy away from the war like it never happened; like, if they don&#8217;t talk about it for long enough, everyone would forget and it would just be a distant memory. However, there are several underlying factors which caused the war that are yet to be resolved, and the new generation is repeating the mistakes of their fathers because nobody bothered to give them a history lesson. I hope this book would enlighten me more on what happened back then, and how to prevent it from happening again. I would definitely be loaning it out to friends when I&#8217;m done.
  
The US Civil war happened over 200 years ago and it is still being taught in schools in the US. We shouldn&#8217;t shy away from our ugly history, but rather, embrace it, using it as a lesson to the future generations so that there would not be a repeat of the mistakes of the past!.
  
More on this when I actually read the damn thing ðŸ˜€
