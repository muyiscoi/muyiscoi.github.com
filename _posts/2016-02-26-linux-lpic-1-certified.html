<p>Last month, I finally took the second exam and final requirement to get my Linux+ certification. It took way longer than I wanted, bit glad I finally did it.<br />
As a result of the Linux+, I also got LPIC-1 and Suse Linux certification.<br />
The certificate and IDs for Comptia and LPIC finally arrived and I'm more pumped than ever to continue on this journey!<br />
Not gonna let things take so long anymore though!</p>
