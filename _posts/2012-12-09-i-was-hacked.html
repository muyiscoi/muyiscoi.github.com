<p>The title kinda says it all. This site was hacked yesterday. I dont know why someone would try to hack my site or if I was just a victim of opportunity. Anyway, whatever the reason, the good news is, i've been able to resolve the issue and get things back to normal. I'll have to implement some backend security and keep a closer watch on things from now on out.</p>
