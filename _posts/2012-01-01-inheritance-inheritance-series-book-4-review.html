<p>This is the last installment in the Inheritance Series, also called Inheritance. It is the concluding part of the story of unassuming teenager turned Dragon Rider and his quest to rid Alagaesia of their evil king, Galbatorix.In this book, Eragon is obviously more matured. His conversations and thoughts nolonger sound like that of a confused teenager (or hatchling in Dragon speak), or an inexperienced rider.</p>
<p>I liked a lot more things in "Inheritance" than I hated, hence the 4 star review. I liked the fact that, although I knew going in that Eragon would defeat Galbatorix, because he just had to, I was still pleasantly surprised at times. I also liked, surprisingly enough, the fact that at the end, nothing transpired romantically between Eragon and Arya. Somehow, it would just have been too weird. I found myself smiling when several generally known facts in the real world were introduced in Inheritance as new information, most notably, "The world is round!". I also like the fact that the author tried not to leave any stone unturned and small parts of the story such as the part with Katrina's father, Sloan, was still revisited before the story was over.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-245"></a>I also liked how the story ended for Mutargh and Thorn. They were able to show that they were not inherently evil, but still didn't end up getting ree-absorbed into the fold. Natsuada was another character that I liked in Inheritance. I found myself sympathising with her as she endured torment at the hand of Mutargh and Galbatorix, and cheering her on while she killed Galbatorix's guards with the sharpened end of a spoon!. The Werecats were more exposed in this book. In previous installments, werecats were only mentioned, and the only one that we saw was Solembum who was always with Angela the Herbalist.</p>
<p>The book is quite long. Not the longest novel I have read but close. I guess it has to be this way since there were a lot of questions to be answered going into the book. The problem is, even after slogging through 600+ pages to get to the end, a lot of those questions have still not been answered. The most mysterious character in the Eragon world is "Angela the Herbalist". Most people expected to gain more insight into exactly who she is, how she is so powerful, where she is from, how old she is, etc. Most of these questions remained unanswered even till the end. I respect the writer's right to leave questions open, pending when he might decide to revisit the world of Alagaesia... or even just to leave it to the overactive imagination of his readers, however, it wouldn't have hurt much, i think to give us a bit more information about Angela.</p>
<p>One character that was blown way out of proportion in my opinion is Roran. From book 1, we initially get no indication that Roran possesses any level of extraordinary intellect or strenght. He is just a normal guy who left his fathers house to go work on a field. However, on joining the Varden, he began showing skills in strenght and tactic of war, which in itself is not so out of place. However, in this book, Roran was taken to a whole new level. He suddenly became a mighty warrior (with no formal training mind you) and master tactician, doing wonders in Aroughs and even Urubean. As if all that was not enough, he had to go and be the one to kill Lord Barst (who killed the queen of the elves, Islanadi). I might have even been content if some sort of "Ancient magiks" was given as an explaination for the source of his strenght and cunning... even if just a small part. Instead, the last nail that sealed the cuffin was given when Eragon was told by the Eldunari at Vroengard that they had been helping him and Saphira from afar. Eragon, who obviously must have considered the incredulity of all the things his brother has been doing, asked them if they had also been helping Roran... and they said "He has not needed our help!". So in essense, this typical farm hand turned hammer swinging fighter suddenly became a great warrior and master war tactician all by himself? Give me a break!.</p>
<p>A major issue, I have noticed, in big series like this, is that when it comes time for the "main bad guy" to be killed, a problem arises. The writer has written this character to be so strong and invulnerable so much so that if he is killed by the protagonist in a one on one combat, it would seem totally impossible. Here lies the dilemma; and the author has to start looking for "ingenious" ways to kill the "main bad guy". It was seen with Harry Potter and Voldemort and again, it is seen here, with Eragon and Galbatorix. I however, feel that Eragon's was slightly better. The author was able to wriggle out of that impossible gridlock he had put himself in and still give us something believable. kudos for that!.</p>
<p>There were parts of this book, albeit small parts, that were difficult to follow. Most notable of which is the arc on Aroughs. All that talk of dams and water gates and what not was lost on me and I just read most of that part as quickly as possible without paying much attention. It quickly got interesting though so I wasn't bored for long.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong><br />
Inheritance is a befitting end to a series such as... Inheritance. It came to a satisfactory end, and although I would have loved more outstanding questions (Angela) to be answered, those were not pertinent to the main story and did not affect the overall delivery. "Eragon Shadeslayer KingKiller DragonRider (RazacBlaster? :D)" is a character that I would remember for a long while and I would definitely check out future works of Christopher Paolini (the author of the series), especially if it is set in Alagaesia!.</p>
