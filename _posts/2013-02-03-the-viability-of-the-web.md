This post is inspired by [this](https://mobility.com.ng/web-is-dead-my-posterior/) post on the mobility blog. I posted it as a comment there but felt it was worth re-posting here also.
  
For some context, the post I&#8217;m replying to is based on the premise that since there are approximately 1.2million sites being published online weekly, the web is not dead, or dying.
  
I repost my response as is below.

How many of those 1.2million sites are personal websites, blogs and the like. The overwhelming majority I’m sure. The web is certainly not dead but if nothing else, its losing mind share. People don’t search for websites of services they have just heard of anymore, they search for them in the app store of their respective devices. It used to be the case that a product launched on the web first, and then released a slew of mobile apps that duplicated a few of the features found on the website, while leaving the rest web exclusive. Such apps could later gain an increased feature set, however, new features still landed on the web first. This could largely still be said to be true, however, with the advent of apps like Instagram, Vine and the like, mobile is put to the forefront first, and the web is little more than an afterthought. This is a trend that is increasingly becoming more prevalent. Mobile apps provide several advantages over web apps, which app developers are keen to tap into. That’s where everyone’s interest lies, or is going to lie moving forward, and since the major aim of a developer is to make money, that’s where his interest will lie also. Discoverability is also higher for apps than they are for websites, as the app store provides an avenue for that. The web is definitely not going anywhere anytime soon, and quite frankly, “the web” is a lot bigger than websites, and most of these apps depend on it in one way or the other. However, it is diminishing in mind share and this would eventually lead to less and less attention being paid to it by developers. Now, I’m not saying this is a particularly good thing. In fact, it
  
isn’t really. It leads to a duplication of effort as several versions of the same app has to be developed for the major platforms, n the minor ones that don’t have as many users are left without a native app, and have to rely on the increasingly neglected web app.
