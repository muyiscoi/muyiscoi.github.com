Since switching over to an [Ubuntu only install](http://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=389) on my laptop a few months ago, I&#8217;ve been wondering how I would side load apps on my [playbook](http://www.muyiscoi.com/?p=345), cos the method I used required a java app running in windows. Since I didn&#8217;t really have any app to side load at the time though, I didn&#8217;t bother looking for a solution. Today, I finally had an app to side load and went about searching for an alternative method of side loading apps for playbook.
  
I came across &#8220;[Playbook App Manager&#8221;](http://gridbook.org/pb-app-mgr/). Its an extension for Chrome or Firefox and it works wherever either browser works. I&#8217;ve tested it and it works really well.
