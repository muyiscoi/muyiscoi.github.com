<p>I loved her before I met her<br />
She was older but it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter<br />
I yearned for her to love me<br />
But it seems her love had gone on a journey</p>
<p>I loved her when I met her<br />
my eyes opened to view the world of her beauty<br />
At that point I was overwhelmed with feeling<br />
Nothing more perfect, the ignorance of not knowing</p>
<p>I love her now that I know her<br />
Her green gown covering the dark <a name="AdBriteInlineAd_patches"><&#47;a><br />
Fiery eyes making light her gruesome injuries<br />
Giving me sadness and a yearning to help her</p>
<p>I love her even though I now know her<br />
I know her decay and rot and decadence<br />
I know her degradation at the hands of detractors<br />
I understand them all and yet I still love her</p>
<p>I love her but others love her too<br />
They love her so much, they misplace her<br />
They pillage and plow in a bid to waste her<br />
I love her but others love to hate her</p>
<p>My love for her makes me want to help her<br />
To deal with all the hatred and save her<br />
I will do my part to hone and heal her<br />
Cos she is my one and only Nigeria</p>
