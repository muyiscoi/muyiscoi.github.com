<p>The title of this post might read like an anti establishment or anti government piece but never fear, it isn't.<br />
Ever since I got to kwara state, I have been using all my electronics without any real surge protection. My rationale was that the power here is pretty stable so I didn't see the need to invest in a voltage stabilizer.<br />
This morning, while in the bathroom, I noticed that my fan had stopped spinning. On coming out, I noticed that the bulbs were dangerously bright. Fearing the worst, I immediately ran to my the mains and switched it off. Unfortunately, it was too little too late. I immediately began perceiving the distinct smell of burnt chargers (a smell I have come to know well unfortunately) and I knew that I was too late.<br />
The list of casualties include by Blackberry phone and playbook chargers as well as the samsung galaxy charger. The only charger that seems to have survived is that of my laptop, although, since I haven't summoned the courage to plug it back, I can't be certain.<br />
So, what's the moral of the story? Don't be a cheapskate!. Buy a voltage stabilizer and save yourself a lot of expenditure in the future.<br />
I guess its safe to say that I've learnt my lesson and would be taking measures to ensure this never happens again.</p>
