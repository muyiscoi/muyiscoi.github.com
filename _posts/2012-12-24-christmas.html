Christmas time is here again. This year, its got me really thinking about the whole juxtaposition of different cultures/traditions and how they all converge together to form the, sometimes really weird, things people do during this season even though, most of them have nothing to do with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span> Christmas.<br />
For instance, whoever decided the Christmas colours had to be red, green and gold (or whatever the combo is these days)?.  Where was that stated in the bible?<br />
Wherever did Santa Claus (Father Christmas) come from and why is he prominently displayed as the avatar for Christmas, even in Churches?<br />
What is the significance of a Christmas tree, especially in Nigeria?<br />
What the heck is "figgy pudding" and why am I <a href="https://www.carols.org.uk/we_wish_you_a_merry_christmas.htm">singing about it</a>?</p>
<p>There are many more conflicts like this I have been pondering over since we entered this season and the more I think about it, the more I realize that Christmas has lost its true meaning. This might sound clich&eacute; 'cos, well, this has been going on for quite a while hasn't it? So, why is it bothering me now?. Well, lets just say, this year, I find that I am doing a lot more thinking; you know, pondering stuff... Deep stuff :D.<br />
So, what's the point of this blog post anyway?. Best I can figure, its meant to inform you that its Christmas day (like you didn't know that already) and that you shouldn't lose sight of the real reason why we are celebrating (Jesus Christ's birth of course, just in case you were wondering)... and If you're not a Christian and are looking for an excuse to have fun, don't do it in the name of celebrating Christmas (maybe you can say xmas or something :)). Well that's all for now.</p>

<p>PS: I did a google search for "Christmas", looking for an appropriate image for this post but all I found were shiny trees, floating carriages, bearded men in red coats, red nosed raindeers, green elves, shiny ornaments, stockings and lots and lots of presents. sigh!. I better stop here before I start all over again.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas everyone!. Celebrate Responsibly.</p>
