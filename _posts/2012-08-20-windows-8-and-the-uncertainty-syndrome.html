    Most humans are resistant to change. But then, the only way to progressive, individually and collectively, is to embrace change.

    Out of curiosity and adventurism alone, I would go for Windows 8.

    Traveller, there is no path. paths are made by people!

    The safer bet for lots of folks would, of course be, go for the tried and tested.

    depends on disposition, I guess!

    Ues, Humans are resistant to change. If I was in your choose, my advise for the guy is to buy the most current Windows 7 tablet. At least it would be upgradable to Windows 8, if he so closes to phrase in the future.

    But we Techies, maybe me in particular, - if I was in his choose, I'd've waited untilWimdows 8 comes out! That's just me. I have to have the latest and the baddest gadget in town!

  content: I had a conversation with someone today (@tech_pundit) that made me begin
    to change my opinion on windows 8. I guess we all just like things to be they
    way they are, especially if the way they are is working just fine. I'm more open
    to the OS now and would definitely give it a fair chance before writing it off.
    I rarely use windows myself (I'm an ubuntu guy), so i won't really feel much change
    in my productivity if i end up hating windows 8.

  content: The person should hold out and get Windows 8. Best value for money.  However,
    there might be  software compatibility issues, so I will advice he prepares his
    mind for a Windows 7 dual boot or virtualization

  content: Not everyone can be bothered about things like virtualisation and software
    compatibility and I feel for such people, Windows 7 might be a better fit, atleast
    for now. Microsoft says all Windows 7 apps would work on windows 8 but that is
    yet to be seen. I remember back in the days of Vista when some XP software would
    cause vista to crash.

<p>Every so often, someone, usually a relative, gets in touch with me to ask about something technology related. They usually ask about issues they or their friends are having, or devices they or their friends want to buy. I like to believe that I have always given good counsel, most of the time having to do lots of research myself because, unlike what they think, I am not a repository of knowledge on everything techy.</p>
<p>Today is like one of those days. I was contacted by my sister via Whatsapp about a friend who wanted to purchase a laptop. I asked her a few questions about what her friend would use the laptop for and proceeded to provide a list of specs to look out for. When I got to "Operating System", I instinctively wrote down "Windows 7" but then I remembered that Windows 8 would be out in a few months and the guy might want to wait for that.<br />
That was when the uncertainty began. Windows 8 is such a drastic change from the norm that it might just be too much change too soon for most people coming from any other earlier version of windows. Should I recommend that this guy wait for Windows 8, or atleast purchase a laptop that would get a free upgrade to Windows 8 and risk tainting my stellar "recommendation reputation" if he doesn't like it, or should I stick to the tried and tested Windows 7? Eventually, I recommended Windows 7 for the guy and left it at that, afterall, Windows 8 isn't even out yet.</p>
<p>I guess all I've been saying boils down to one point. What would be the reaction of the average Joe out there to Windows 8? The ones that haven't been following its development and know nothing of the Metro UI. The unsuspecting accountant who hears about an update to the OS on his home computer and goes ahead to buy it only to be presented with a screen filled with brightly coloured boxes and constantly changing images?.<br />
Would his first instinct be to look for a way to go back to what he had before or would he decide to give it a chance and grow to like it? Only time will tell I guess and all we can do for now is speculate.
