A couple of months ago, I headed down to London for the weekend.

I don't often go to London because its quite far away (5+hrs by train), and I don't always have a good reason to, but this time I did.
I had an appointment at the Nigerian High Commission on Monday, and had used the opportunity to make a weekend of it.

On arriving in London on Saturday, I immediately headed down to the Royal Albert Hall where I had a ticket to see the matinee performance of The Piano Guys.

The show was awesome by the way. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.


Afterwards, I walked around for a bit and then caught a bus to the Lyceum Theatre to watch The Lion King Live, again another phenomenal show.
As you can imagine, after spending all morning travelling and then catching two incredible shows, I was both tired and satisfied.

I had plans to meet up with some colleages who also happened to be down in London for some work related stuff the next day and we were gonna just wonder around London for the day.


On the bus back to my Airbnb from the Lyceum theatre though, I got a chat message from my brother back home asking if I was okay. He knew that I was in London for the weekend and said he'd just read about a terror attack on the news.

I immediately went to the BBC website and saw that there had indeed been an attack at the London bridge, literally minutes after the theatre performance I was at had ended.
Lyceum theatre is about 30 minutes away from the scene of the attack.

I come from a country that is the home base for a ruthless terror organisation, however this was the closest I had ever come to something like that.


I immediately reassured my brother that I was okay, and posted on our family group chat to let everyone else know I was fine. The rest of my weekend went perfectly, and I was still able to have fun with my colleages around London the day after.

The randomness of the event though has stuck with me ever since, and with yet another terror attack in London today, albeit a much less fatal one, thankfully, I began to recall this surreal experience I had and thought to write about it.


I know that in the grand scheme of things, I wasn't really in any danger, and definitely do not wish to diminish the experiences of others who had a more direct contact with the event, or indeed, those who lost their lives or the lives of their loved ones.

Just thought I should write about this surreal experience I had as a way to make sense of it in my head.

Suffice it to say, I don't think I have been very successful.
