I came across this book called &#8220;**The Martian**&#8221; by &#8220;Andy Weir&#8221; today, from an article on the upcoming movie adaptation starring Matt Damon. The synopsis sounds pretty interesting and the trailer piqued my interest, so I&#8217;ve decided to read the book.
  
<!--more-->Its been a while since I completed reading any book, as I&#8217;ve abandoned all my attempts over the last few months. I&#8217;ve started reading books such as the &#8220;

**Afton of Margate Castle&#8221;** by Angela Hunt, The fourth book in &#8220;**The Heroes of Olympus**&#8221; series by Rick Riordan (can&#8217;t remember the title), &#8220;**The Paper Magician**&#8221; by Charlie Holmberg, etc but for several reasons, I&#8217;ve not been able to complete them. I do intend to get back to all these books at some point though, after all, I already have them loaded on my Kindle, however, I first need to break my recent pattern of abandoning books and I have high hopes that &#8220;The Martian&#8221; is just what the doctor ordered.
  
I also recently discovered this awesome book &#8220;**The Alchemist**&#8221; by Paolo Coelho and it appears I am extremely late to the party on that one. Again, I came across it from news of an upcoming movie adaptation. I&#8217;ll be sure to dive right into that once I&#8217;m done with &#8220;The Martian&#8221;.
  
It&#8217;s the summer and I happen to have a lot of time on my hands right now, so its the best time to get back to reading again.
  
Can&#8217;t wait!.
