So, since I registered this domain in 2010, it has been the home of my personal website/blog in its numerous incarnations, hosted on a [shared hosting service](http://smartweb.com.ng).

This has mostly served me well, despite the sometimes flaky uptime, mostly cos my site has a non-existent readership. Despite this fact, I&#8217;ve always wanted to host my site on a home server, so now, I&#8217;m doing that, or atleast the next best thing.

I just migrated my site to a droplet on Digital ocean. I also took the opportunity to move it to a folder, leaving the homepage as a kind of about me type thing, which i&#8217;m hopefully gonna design within the next week.

This is part of my larger plan to self host as much of the services that I use as possible. There are lots of awesome opensource software out there for just about any service you might want, and I intend to take advantage of them, and rid myself of an over dependence on large companies.

That&#8217;s the plan right now anyway. We&#8217;ll see how it goes. For now, at least I have liberated my site from a shared host, so i no longer have to cover my face in shame. ðŸ˜€
