<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.muyiscoi.com&#47;blog&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;mmulshine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-753" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.muyiscoi.com&#47;blog&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;mmulshine-580x512.jpg" alt="mmulshine" width="580" height="512" &#47;><&#47;a>I just though I should pop in quickly to note this on my blog (that nobody reads) as a PSA. Facebook Apps are possibly one of the most destructive forces in the universe today.<br />
No, really!.<br />
There is almost no upside to using them, yet people can't seem to get enough of them. When you see an app that wants to tell you "Who is secretly in Love with you", you know deep in your heart that its gonna be giving you some BS. Same thing goes for just about every other Facebook app out there.</p>
<p>In order to install a Facebook app on your account, you have to give it access to all sorts of information from your friends list to your profile, etc. You also give it access to post stuff on your behalf on your page. Most people don't review all these permissions before installing those apps, and most of the time, they come back to bite you in the arse.</p>
<p>The developers of most of those apps couldn't&nbsp;care less&nbsp;about "Who is your secret admirer", and probably couldn't figure that out anyway, based on the data available to them. What they are interested in though, is the ability to capture as much data about you as they possibily can (made much easier by all the access you've given them) and sell that to advertisers and other more sinister elements.</p>
<p>The more egregious of the bunch would then proceed to use your wall as a personal spam generator, posting all sort of click-bait, and sometimes obscene, articles that seem to have been posted by you. Suddenly, you might begin to notice your friends asking you about some suspicious looking links you've been posting recently.</p>
<p>At that point, most people will assume that they have been "hacked" and would proceed to changing their password (which of course does nothing to fix the issue), while forgetting that app they installed a year ago that claimed to show them "What you will look like in 60 years) but just figured out their race and showed a generic image of an old person instead.</p>
<p>If you are currently an avid installer of Facebook apps, all is not lost. Its pretty easy to figure out how to uninstall Facebook apps from your account with a quick google search.<br />
Your time is much better spent actually interacting with people on social media, and your data&#47;integrity is much safer for it.</p>
