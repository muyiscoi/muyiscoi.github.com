<p>I deployed a Raspberry Pi2 server at home to act as my Plex Media server and it has been working well for over a week now. I am also using it to learn more about server administration. Today, I realized that I had a lot of files in the Trash of my external hard drive connected to the Pi and decided to sort them out.</p>
<p>While doing the sorting, I intended to run this command</p>
<blockquote><p>mv *&#47;*.* .<&#47;blockquote><br />
but instead, ran</p>
<blockquote><p>mv &#47;*&#47;*.* &#47;<&#47;blockquote><br />
as root user.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with the Linux command line, you realize the epic mistake I made. I realized the problem a little too late though, and now my server is completely ruined. Gotta go back home and reprovision everything from scratch.</p>
<p>Guess I have to be more careful in the future. See what forward slash in the wrong places can cause!.</p>
