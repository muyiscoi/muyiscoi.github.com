<p>I've been on a mission to self host as much stuff as possible. I am trying to improve my security on the web, as well as have more control over my data. I began by moving this blog from a shared hosting platform to Digital ocean. Next, I setup an email server on my domain, which gives me the ability to have *@muyiscoi.com email addresses. I naturally had to add an SSL cert to ensure that email clients don't have trouble trusting my domain.</p>
<p>I have also setup owncloud on Digital ocean to facilitate syncing files between my devices without having to rely on third party services.</p>
<p>On the security side of things, I have gone round and enabled 2-factor Auth on as many services as I can that has that option. I have also changed virtually all my passwords to very strong passwords from an online Password generator, each account having its own password.</p>
<p>Naturally, I would not be able to remember all these passwords, so had to use a password manager. I setup KeepassX on the Fedora install on my laptop, and synchronized the keepass database file with Owncloud to my phone, and other devices. So, now, I can have access to all my passwords on any device I have that supports keepassx, which is virtually every OS at this point. The database file is protected as well, and I have setup pin codes on the apps, for an added layer of security.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing process, and I intend to implement more solutions to improve my control on the services I use, in turn having more control over my data and security.<br />
The idea is to find a sweet spot that doesn't sacrifice too much ease but provides better security.</p>
