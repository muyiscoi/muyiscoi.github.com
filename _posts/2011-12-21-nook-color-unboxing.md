Just took delivery of my brand new [Nook Color](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-color-barnes-noble/1100437663) over the weekend. I wasÂ  away and didn&#8217;t have access to WiFi and as a result, couldn&#8217;t do much with the device until today. I took snapshots of the unboxing though and they are in the gallery below. After playing with the device for about a week, i&#8217;ll share my views on it. Suffice it to say, so far, I am loving a lot of things about it. More on that later. For now, enjoy the unboxing pics.
