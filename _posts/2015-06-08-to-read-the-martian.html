<p>I came across this book called "<strong>The Martian<&#47;strong>" by "Andy Weir" today, from an article on the upcoming movie adaptation starring Matt Damon. The synopsis sounds pretty interesting and the trailer piqued my interest, so I've decided to read the book.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-698"></a>Its been a while since I completed reading any book, as I've abandoned all my attempts over the last few months. I've started reading books such as the "<strong>Afton of Margate Castle"<&#47;strong> by Angela Hunt, The fourth book in "<strong>The Heroes of Olympus<&#47;strong>" series by Rick Riordan (can't remember the title), "<strong>The Paper Magician<&#47;strong>" by Charlie Holmberg, etc but for several reasons, I've not been able to complete them. I do intend to get back to all these books at some point though, after all, I already have them loaded on my Kindle, however, I first need to break my recent pattern of abandoning books and I have high hopes that "The Martian" is just what the doctor ordered.<br />
I also recently discovered this awesome book "<strong>The Alchemist<&#47;strong>" by Paolo Coelho and it appears I am extremely late to the party on that one. Again, I came across it from news of an upcoming movie adaptation. I'll be sure to dive right into that once I'm done with "The Martian".<br />
It's the summer and I happen to have a lot of time on my hands right now, so its the best time to get back to reading again.<br />
Can't wait!.</p>
