<p><img class="alignleft" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Fargo_%28TV_logo%29.png" width="250" height="158" />Despite the fact that I'm a huge fan of TV, I just realized that I haven't really written about any show on this blog. I'm going to remedy that right now.</p>
<p>Fargo was a movie by The Coen Brothers released back in 1996. Its basic premise is that it follows the story of murders and intrigue from different people's perspectives all in and around Fargo, North Dakota (which is a real place).</p>
<p>Almost two decades later, the concept was revived in form of an anthology TV show. There are currently two seasons of the show with a third set to premier next year. The first season has big names such as Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman as part of the cast. The fact that its an anthology series and runs for just 10 episodes per season must make it easier to attract huge stars that don't necessarily want to get tied down in multi-year TV shows.</p>
<p>Anyway, all this to say I highly recommend checking this show out. Netflix here in the UK only had the first season available, but the second was just added a couple of weeks ago and I'm currently making my way through that.</p>
