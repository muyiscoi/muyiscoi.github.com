I am a sucker for fantasy books, especially when they are in series. I know, most of them fall into the kids, teens or young adult genre but i don&#8217;t care.

Of recent, I have been intrigued by novels exploring mythology, especially greek mythology. The reason, i think, is that they are so appealing and interesting and lots of exciting stories can be churned out of them when in the right hands.

Over the past couple of years, that right hand has been [Rick Riordan](http://rickriordan.com), the author of International Best selling series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and now a new series called &#8220;The heroes of Olympus&#8221;, among other books. Riordan very skillfully merges Greek, and now Roman mythology into modern times and make those old stories shine anew and captivate readers until they are almost believable.

I just completed reading the first installment in his new series &#8220;The heroes of Olympus&#8221; titled &#8220;The Lost Hero&#8221; and i can&#8217;t wait for the next one to be released.

To any readers out there who share my love of fantasy and young adult fiction (sans romance), i whole heartedly recommend Rick Riordan&#8217;s books. Having completely read all the books in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series and now reading The heroes of Olympus series, i can confidently say that this is one author that knows his stuff in his chosen genre.
