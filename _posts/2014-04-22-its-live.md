It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but this past Sunday the CBC media team launched the Central Baptist Church Website over at http://centralbaptistchurchphc.org. It&#8217;s a mouthful, I know. We&#8217;re probably gonna have a shorter redirect for that in the future.

The site is built on joomla 2.5 with a premium template which has been heavily modified. It features several joomla for sliders, calendars, etc.

The site is still a work in progress as several pages are yet to bring filled. There is still lots to get done.
  
Kudos to all the guys in the team for rushing to ensure we had something presentable for Sunday.
